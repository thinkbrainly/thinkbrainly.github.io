3. As for EM waves, they can travel through empty space or vacuum so they do not give up their energy. This enables EM waves to
cross great distances such as that from the sun to the Earth (which is almost vacuum) without losing much energy. In vacuum, EM waves
travel at a constant speed of

He is theframane is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another, Waves cranWaves can be mechanical, electromagnetic, transverse, and longitudinal.Parand waves are also longitudinal waves. The disturbance is in the same direction orAmplitude refers to the distance of the maximum vertical displacement of the wave fromits equilibrium position. The larger the amplitude, the higher the energy. High amplitude isequivalent to loud sounds.The physical distance between two consecutive peaks in a sound wave is referred to asthe wavelength of the sound wave.7. Frequency in a sound wave refers to the rate of the vibration of the sound travelling throughthe air. It is the number of wave cycle that passes a point in a given time. The frequencyof the vibrating source of sound is calculated in cycles per second. The higher thefrequency, the higher is the pitch.8. Wavelength and frequency of a sound wave are related mathematically as: The Speed ofSound = Frequency X Wavelength9. The speed of a sound wave varies on the type of material it travels through, and its speedin air depends mostly on air temperature.10. Generally, sound waves travel fastest through solids and slowest through gases.​</a>

Wavdangin, Amplitude, Time-Period, frequency and Velocity or Speed. The is the leren of one complete wave. It also refers to the distance between the centers of two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions. The time required to produce one compete wave or cycle is called (5) of the wave. The distance traveled by aware one second is called the velocity of the wave or (6) of the wave. Sound seves travel fastest through (7) and slowest through (8) Temperature a so se the speed of sound, a lower temperature means that partides of the medium are movine more (9) so it takes them longer to transfer the energy of the sound waves. Frequency is one of the important characteristics of sound which refers to the rate of 103 of the sound traveling through the air. This parameter decides whether a sound is perceived as high pitched or low pitched. When the frequency of sound ister the och is (11) On the other hand, if the frequency is low, the pitch is (12) Another characteristic of sound is amplitude which refers to the magnitude of 13 and expansion experienced by the medium the sound wave is traveling through. High amplitude means (14) sounds. Los amplitude means 115 sounds. Figure rps the oute: sand putes ea qyes to the​</a>

The disturbance is in the same direction orAmplitude refers to the distance of the maximum vertical displacement of the wave fromits equilibrium position. The larger the amplitude, the higher the energy. High amplitude isequivalent to loud sounds.The physical distance between two consecutive peaks in a sound wave is referred to asthe wavelength of the sound wave.7. Frequency in a sound wave refers to the rate of the vibration of the sound travelling throughthe air. It is the number of wave cycle that passes a point in a given time. The frequencyof the vibrating source of sound is calculated in cycles per second. The higher thefrequency, the higher is the pitch.8.

Wavdangin, Amplitude, Time-Period, frequency and Velocity or Speed. The is the leren of one complete wave. It also refers to the distance between the centers of two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions. The time required to produce one compete wave or cycle is called (5) of the wave. The distance traveled by aware one second is called the velocity of the wave or (6) of the wave. Sound seves travel fastest through (7) and slowest through (8) Temperature a so se the speed of sound, a lower temperature means that partides of the medium are movine more (9) so it takes them longer to transfer the energy of the sound waves. Frequency is one of the important characteristics of sound which refers to the rate of 103 of the sound traveling through the air. This parameter decides whether a sound is perceived as high pitched or low pitched. When the frequency of sound ister the och is (11) On the other hand, if the frequency is low, the pitch is (12) Another characteristic of sound is amplitude which refers to the magnitude of 13 and expansion experienced by the medium the sound wave is traveling through.

Matter is NOT carried with the wave! A wave can move through matter (a medium). If it must have a medium, it is called a mechanical wave</p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Sound</strong><strong> </strong><strong>wave</strong></p><p></p><p>The sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the speed of sound, thus forming the sound wave.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I.Light wave </strong></p><p></p><p>The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is the range of all types of EM radiation. Radiation is energy that travels and spreads out as it goes – the visible light that comes from a lamp in your house and the radiowaves that come from a radio station are two types of electromagnetic radiation.</p><p></p><p>When most people use the term light waves, they usually mean visiblelight. In physics however, the term light waves tends to be used as a synonym for electromagnetic waves. ... From lowest energy to highest energy (red to blue) there are radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visiblelight, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. J.Ultraviolet wave</strong></p><p></p><p>All of the energy from the Sun that reaches the Earth arrives as solar radiation, part of a large collection of energy called the electromagnetic radiation spectrum.Solar radiation includes visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays</p><p></p><p><strong>5-7. </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>A,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>C,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>F</strong></p><strong>Longitudinal waves</strong> – In this type of wave, the movement of the particle are parallel to the motion of the energy i.e. the displacement of the medium is in the same direction to which the wave is moving. Example – Sound Waves, Pressure Waves.<strong>Transverse waves</strong> –  When the movement of the particles is at right angles or perpendicular to the motion of the energy, then this type of wave is known as Transverse wave.  Light is an example of a transverse wave. Some of the other examples are – ‘Polarized’ waves &amp; Electromagnetic waves<strong>Su</strong><strong>rface waves</strong> – In this type, the particles travel in a circular motion.  These waves usually occur at interfaces. Waves in the ocean and ripples in a cup of water are examples of such waves.<p></p><p><strong>8.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>m.wave length</strong></p><p>The vertical distance between the crest and the trough is the wave height.

The vertical distance between the crest and the trough is the wave height.</p><p></p><p><strong>11. N.

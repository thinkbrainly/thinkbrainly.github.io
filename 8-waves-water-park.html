Write your answer in your answer in your answer sheets._____________11. At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them (longer, shorter) time to transfer the energy of the sound waves._____________12. Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. Molecules at (higher, lower) temperatures have more energy, thus they can vibrate faster, therefore sound waves can travel more quickly._____________13. As the temperature (increases, decreases), particles vibrate slowly, then sound travels faster._____________14. Sound moves (faster, slower) in warm air than colder air, the wave bends away from the warm air and back toward the ground. That's why sound is able to travel farther on a cold days._____________15. The higher the temperature of the medium, the (higher, lower) is the speed of sound in the medium.​</a>

                                            an amazing place in Japan. Artificial Beaches, Anyone? Although Japan is surrounded by sea, the waters are not great for swimming. They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid! Think It Over I. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Source: Money-Saver Magazine, April 1994 How are the seas surrounding Japan described in the selection? How did Japan solve its problem with its beaches? What is the world's biggest indoor water park? Where is it located? Where do young people in Japan gather to have fun during summer or even in winter? What is the scene inside the Dome of Miyazaki like? What do all these man-made beaches remind us Filipinos? What does the article aim to tell us? What may happen if we do not care for our beaches? ​</a>

At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly, so it takes them (longer, shorter) time to transfer the energy of the sound waves._____________12. Temperature is also a condition that affects the speed of sound. Molecules at (higher, lower) temperatures have more energy, thus they can vibrate faster, therefore sound waves can travel more quickly._____________13. As the temperature (increases, decreases), particles vibrate slowly, then sound travels faster._____________14. Sound moves (faster, slower) in warm air than colder air, the wave bends away from the warm air and back toward the ground. That's why sound is able to travel farther on a cold days._____________15. The higher the temperature of the medium, the (higher, lower) is the speed of sound in the medium.​</h2><br />

                            25. an amazing place in Japan. Artificial Beaches, Anyone? Although Japan is surrounded by sea, the waters are not great for swimming. They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid! Think It Over I. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Source: Money-Saver Magazine, April 1994 How are the seas surrounding Japan described in the selection? How did Japan solve its problem with its beaches? What is the world's biggest indoor water park? Where is it located? Where do young people in Japan gather to have fun during summer or even in winter? What is the scene inside the Dome of Miyazaki like? What do all these man-made beaches remind us Filipinos? What does the article aim to tell us? What may happen if we do not care for our beaches? ​</h2><br />

The Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort is located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island.</p><p></p><p>5. Young people in Japan gather at indoor water parks such as the Wild Blue Yokohama to have fun during summer or even in winter.</p><p></p><p>6. The scene inside the Dome of Miyazaki is like a Caribbean Island with realistic features including beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, sand, and an equipment that produces artificial waves.</p><p></p><p>7. The man-made beaches remind Filipinos how lucky and blessed they are because the Philippines has been endowed with many fascinating natural beaches.</p><p></p><p>8. The article aims to tell us about Japan's high-tech solution to its problem with its beaches and how Filipinos should take good care of the natural beaches in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>9. If we do not care for our beaches, they may lose their natural beauty which may lead to the need for importing another product from Japan - artificial beaches.</p><p></p><br />

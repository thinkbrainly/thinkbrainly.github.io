                        <p>At the middle of <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> (Touch Me Not) by Philippine national hero Dr. Jose Rizal is the conflict against Spanish colonialism. The Philippines, which is named after King Philip II of Spain, was ruled by the Spanish empire as a colony from 1565 until the Philippine Revolution ended this rule in 1898. For his part in the Philippine Revolution, Dr. Jose Rizal was tried and convicted for rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. His sentence was to be death by firing squad. Juan Crisostomo Ibarra, one of the main character in <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> (which means Touch Me Not), returns to the Philippines after a seven year absence studying in Europe. He is engaged to the other main character named Maria Clara, the beautiful daughter of Captain Tiago. With this work, Rizal set out to write a novel that would expose the ills and problems of the Philippine society and in so doing created a passionate love story set against the backdrop of the political conflict against a repressive government.</p><p></p><p>Related Link: </p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/106582</strong></p><p></p><br />

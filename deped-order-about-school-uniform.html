While this order has been subject to much criticism, I believe that the pros heavily outweigh the cons, and that its implementation can potentially benefit students, teachers and the education system as a whole.</p><p></p><p>To begin with, the most prominent benefit of the order is its emphasis on the physical and mental well-being of students. It makes clear that students should be protected from any form of physical and mental harm. This includes bullying, harassment, cyberbullying, and other types of mental and physical violence. By outlawing such behaviours, DepEd Order 49, 2022 will help students focus on their studies without worrying about their safety. This will also help create a safe and conducive learning environment, which is beneficial for both students and teachers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the order also seeks to regulate the physical and mental health of students. This includes ensuring that students have regular medical check-ups, are provided with sufficient nutrition and rest, and that they are kept away from any activities that might be harmful to their physical and mental health. By implementing such measures, DepEd Order 49, 2022 will help students stay in good health and help them achieve better academic performance. This will indirectly benefit teachers as well, as they will be able to monitor the physical and mental health of their students more effectively.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the order also seeks to ensure that students are provided with the necessary resources and support in order to be successful in their academic pursuits. This includes providing students with the necessary supplies and services, such as access to qualified professionals and proper guidance. By doing so, DepEd Order 49, 2022 will help students be more successful in their studies and help them achieve their academic goals.</p><p></p><p>Overall, DepEd Order 49, 2022 is an important document that seeks to establish regulations and guidelines to protect students from physical and mental harm. Despite its controversial nature, it has many positive implications for students, teachers, and the education system as a whole. Therefore, I believe that its implementation is highly beneficial and should be encouraged.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The controversial Department of Education (DepED) Order No. 49 s. 2022 has two goals: To depoliticize the department and promote professionalism among its personnel.</p><p></p><p>After gaining complaints from educators and the public alike, DepED Spokesperson Michael Poa, in a televised interview, clarified the goal of the department’s issuance of DO No. 49.</p><p></p><p>According to Poa, DO 49 is just a mere “reminder” to observe the “existing rules” as civil servants. Under the issuance, DepED personnel were mandated to treat colleagues and learners with the “highest degree of professionnalism There’s no specific trigger in the issuance of the order. In fact, the DO refers to the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards [for Public Officials and Employees] or what we call Republic Act 6713. We’re just issuing this order to remind DepED personnel in terms of professionalism and depoliticization [in the department],” said Poa in an interview over CNN Philippines on Tuesday, Nov. 15.</p><p>Apart from serving their duties in “prompt,” “courteous,” and “fair” manner, educators were likewise told to “avoid relationships, interaction, and communication including following social media with learners” outside school setting.As civil servants, we have to be responsible [while using] social media,” said Poa, adding that teachers may still communicate with learners through social media “as long as it is within the school setting,” or is limited within the “student-teacher” relationship.</p><p></p><p>“We are just reminding them of their duty to also be professional teachers,” Poa added.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines slammed this order, calling it “ir</p><p>Requests in most Philippine government agencies, according to Poa, are now being politicized and this specific scenario is what DepED is “avoiding” to happen</p><p></p><br />

                            7. Based on the DepEd order in PTA collection, why are school very strict with money collection​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> you can just rephrase that hehe</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippine Department of Education (DepEd) has issued an order for parents-teachers associations (PTAs) to strictly collect money from parents for various school activities and projects. This strict approach to money collection is necessary for several reasons.</p><p></p><p>First, the DepEd order ensures that PTAs have the funds they need to carry out their important tasks. PTAs play a vital role in supporting the school and its students, and they require adequate funding to carry out their activities and projects. By ensuring that money is collected in a strict and consistent manner, the DepEd order helps PTAs to have the resources they need to support the school and its students.</p><p></p><p>Second, the strict approach to money collection helps to promote fairness and equality among students. Some parents may be able or willing to contribute more money than others, and a strict approach to collection helps to ensure that all students have the same opportunities, regardless of their family's financial situation. This is important for creating a fair and inclusive learning environment for all students.</p><p></p><p>Third, the strict approach to money collection also helps to promote accountability and transparency. PTAs are responsible for managing the funds they collect, and a strict approach to collection helps to ensure that the money is used wisely and in accordance with the needs of the school and its students. This helps to promote trust and confidence in the PTA, and encourages parents to support their efforts.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the DepEd order for strict money collection by PTAs is necessary for several reasons. It helps to ensure that PTAs have the funds they need to support the school and its students, promotes fairness and equality among students, and promotes accountability and transparency in the management of PTA funds.</p><br />

Most of these children live in rural and far flung areas whose parents need to be aware of educational opportunities that these children could avail of.</p><p>The Department of Education (DepED) has organized the urgency to address this problem and therefore, guarantees the right for these children to receive appropriate education within the regular or inclusive classroom setting. Inclusive education embraces the philosophy of accepting all children regardless of race, size, shape, color, ability or disability with support from school staff, students, parents and the community.</p><p>A comprehensive inclusive program for children with special needs has the following components:</p><p>Child Find. This is locating where these children are through the family mapping survey, advocacy campaigns and networking with local health workers. The children with special needs who are not in school shall be listed using Enclosure No. 1. These children shall be visited by Special Education (SPED) teachers and parents should be convinced to enroll their children in SPED Centers or schools nearest their home.</p><p>Assessment. This is the continuous process of identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the child through the use of formal and informal tools for proper program grade placement. Existing SPED Centers in the Division shall assist regular schools in the assessment process.</p><p>Program Options. Regular schools with or without trained SPED teachers shall be provided educational services to children with special needs. These schools shall access educational services from SPED Centers or SPED trained teachers.The first program option that shall be organized for these children is a self-contained class for children with similar disabilities which can be mono-grade or multi-grade handled by a trained SPED teacher.The second option is inclusion or placement of the child with disabilities in general education or regular class where he/she learns with his/her peers under a regular teacher and/or SPED trained teacher who addresses the child’s needs.</p><p>The third option is a resource room program where the child with disabilities shall be pulled out from the general education or regular class and shall report to a SPED teacher who provides small group/one-on-one instruction and/or appropriate interventions for these children.</p><p></p><p>Curriculum Modifications. This shall be implemented in the forms of adaptations and accommodations to foster optimum learning based on individual’s needs and potentials. Modification in classroom instructions and activities is a process that involves new ways of thinking and developing teaching-learning practices.It also involves changes in any of the steps in the teaching-learning process. Curriculum modifications shall include service delivery options like cooperative or team teaching, consulting teacher program and others. The provision of support services from professionals and specialists, parents, volunteers, and peers or buddies to the children with special needs is an important feature in the inclusion program.</p><p>Parental Involvement. This plays a vital role in preparing the children in academic, moral and spiritual development. Parents shall involve themselves in observing children’s performance, volunteering to work in the classroom as teacher aide and providing support to other parents.</p><p>District and school-based special education and regular teachers, administrators and parents need to collaboratively develop and facilitate the most effective program for children with disabilities. This program shall be included in the School Improvement Plan (SIP).</p><p>To realize the successful implementation of inclusive education in the schools, the duties and responsibilities of DepED officials are defined in Enclosure No. 2.</p><p>Officials at the division, region and central offices shall provide the needed training on inclusive education to administrators, teachers and other school staff; regularly monitor the implementation of the program and provide the corresponding technical assistance needed and conduct evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the program and improve its implementation.</p><p>Immediate dissemination of and compliance with this Order is directed.</p><p>Encls.: As stated</p><p>Reference: None</p><p>Allotment: 1—(D.O. 50-97)</p><p>To be indicated in the Perpetual Index under the following subjects:</p><p>SPECIAL EDUCATION</p><p>TEACHERS</p><p>POLICY</p><p>PROGRAM</p><p></p><p>DO_s2009_72</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. Essay about School Uniform​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>School uniforms have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that school uniforms are necessary for promoting discipline and improving academic performance, while others believe that uniforms stifle individuality and creativity. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the main benefits of school uniforms is that they promote a sense of discipline and order among students. By requiring students to wear a uniform, schools are able to enforce a certain level of conformity and discourage behaviors that might disrupt the learning environment. This can help to create a more focused and productive atmosphere in the classroom.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition, school uniforms can help to reduce social inequality and promote a sense of equality among students. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, it is harder to tell who is wealthy and who is not. This can help to reduce bullying and other forms of social exclusion that can be based on clothing or other markers of socioeconomic status.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>On the other hand, critics argue that school uniforms stifle individuality and creativity. They argue that students should be allowed to express themselves through their clothing and that uniforms can be too restrictive. This can be especially problematic for students who may not have a lot of other outlets for self-expression.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore, school uniforms can be expensive and can create an additional financial burden for families who may already be struggling. This can lead to feelings of resentment or unfairness among students who are unable to afford the latest styles or trends.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to school uniforms. While uniforms can promote discipline and equality, they may also stifle individuality and create financial burdens for families. Ultimately, the decision to implement school uniforms should be based on the needs and values of the individual school community.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Persuasive speech on school uniforms</p><p></p><p>I believe that having a school uniform would be a good thing for multiple reasons. The first being how it would completely and utterly eradicate the issue of dress code. The next reason is how it would be able to create a more focused learning environment by eliminating clothing distractions.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p></p><p>Today, I am here to talk to you about the importance of school uniforms.</p><p></p><p>First of all, let me ask you a question: why do we have schools in the first place? Is it not to provide a safe and conducive environment for children to learn and grow? A school uniform is one way to ensure that this environment is maintained.</p><p></p><p>When students wear uniforms, they are immediately identifiable as part of the school community. This promotes a sense of belonging and unity among students. It also helps to reduce bullying and other forms of aggression, as students are not able to judge each other based on their clothes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, school uniforms promote equality among students. In a world where children can sometimes be judged based on the clothes they wear or the things they own, a school uniform levels the playing field. It ensures that all students are treated the same, regardless of their socio-economic background.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these benefits, school uniforms can also save parents money. Instead of having to buy their child a new wardrobe every season, parents can simply purchase a few sets of uniforms that can be worn year-round. This can be a significant financial relief for many families.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps most importantly, school uniforms help to create a sense of discipline and order in the school. When students are dressed in the same clothes, they are more likely to focus on their studies and less likely to get distracted by their appearance or the clothes of their peers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, school uniforms promote unity, equality, and discipline in the school community. They provide a safe and conducive environment for children to learn and grow. Let us support the use of school uniforms and help our children get the most out of their education. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>brainliest please thank you!!</p><br />

Friction is useful to our daily living6. The rubbing of your hanós ogether is an example of friction.7. If you push or pull against an object in motion, it will start8. Smooth surfaces create the most friction.9. Low friction will slow down something and will create lot of heat.10. Moving objects like cars run easily and fast in a smooth surface.11. Gravity is a force that resists the movement of an object sliding against each another.12. Friction keeps everything firmly on the ground.13. Anything that goes up ultimately goes down. This statement explains the meaning of gravity-14. The greater mass an object has, the greater its weight.15. Gravity is a noncontact Lorce.16. Thomas A. Edison discovered the principle of gravity.17. Friction is a force between two bodies which are in contact with each other.18. The gravitational force exerted by the earth on an object is equivalent to the object's weight.19. If the earth's mass is increased the weight of objects in it will also increased.20.

Although all three of these words refer to changes due to contact between different cultures, there are notable differences between them. Acculturation is often tied to political conquest or expansion, and is applied to the process of change in beliefs or traditional practices that occurs when the cultural system of one group displaces that of another. Assimilation refers to the process through which individuals and groups of differing heritages acquire the basic habits, attitudes, and mode of life of an embracing culture. Amalgamation refers to a blending of cultures, rather than one group eliminating another (acculturation) or one group mixing itself into another (assimilation).</p><p></p><p></p>sana makatulong!#brainlyeveryday<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Thyroid Gland - It regulates the metabolism of the body, so during exercise, it produces more hormones to increase metabolic rate and burn more calories for energy.</p><p></p><p>2. Placenta - Produces hormones that support the pregnancy, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to maintain the pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone to prepare the uterus for childbirth and lactation.</p><p></p><p>3. Adrenal Gland - Releases adrenaline (epinephrine) to activate the "fight or flight" response, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and providing energy for the body to respond to danger.</p><p></p><p>4. Pituitary Gland - Releases growth hormone (GH) that stimulates the growth of bones, muscles, and organs during childhood and adolescence.</p><p></p><p>5. Adrenal Gland - Releases cortisol in response to stress or illness, which can increase blood sugar levels, suppress the immune system, and promote the breakdown of muscle tissue for energy.</p><p></p><p>6. Pancreas - Releases insulin to regulate blood sugar levels, allowing cells to absorb glucose for energy, and preventing excess glucose from accumulating in the bloodstream.</p><p></p><p>7. Adipose Tissue - Produces adipokines, which can increase inflammation and insulin resistance, leading to obesity-related health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><p></p><p>8. Pituitary Gland - Insufficient production of GH can result in dwarfism or short stature.</p><p></p><p>9. Thyroid Gland - Swelling in the neck could be a goiter, which may be caused by an iodine deficiency or other thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.</p><p></p><p>10. Parathyroid Gland - Produces parathyroid hormone (PTH) that regulates calcium and phosphorus levels in the body, so osteoporosis (bone loss) can occur when there is too much PTH or not enough calcium in the diet.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Shoes can affect how someone runs depending on the fit, cushioning, and support they provide. Ill-fitting shoes or shoes without proper support can cause discomfort, pain, or injury during running.</p><p></p><p>2. Hollows and bumps can affect motion by creating uneven surfaces, which can cause changes in speed or direction. For example, running on a bumpy surface may require more effort and cause a slower pace compared to running on a flat surface.</p><p></p><p>3. In a rough surface, an object may move with more difficulty due to increased friction between the object and the surface. The surface can also cause the object to move unevenly or change direction more frequently.</p><p></p><p>4. In a smooth surface, an object may move more easily due to less friction between the object and the surface. The object can also move more evenly and maintain its direction more easily.</p><p></p><p>5. An object moves more easily on a smooth surface because there is less friction, allowing the object to move with less resistance. Rough surfaces can create more friction and cause an object to move with more difficulty.</p><p></p><p>6. Running on a wet floor can be more challenging than running on a dry floor due to reduced traction, which can increase the risk of slipping and falling.</p><p></p><p>7. Moving objects on a rough surface may move with more difficulty and require more force compared to objects on a smooth surface. Objects on a smooth surface may also maintain their direction more easily.</p><p></p><p>8. The rubbing of two surfaces against each other is called friction.</p><p></p><p>9. The speed of a moving object can be affected by factors such as the force applied to the object, the mass of the object, and the amount of friction between the object and its surface.</p><p></p><p>10. Friction is important in our lives because it allows us to grip objects, walk without slipping, and control the motion of our vehicles. Without friction, many everyday activities would be more difficult or impossible to perform.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>1.</p><p>a. Type of mutation: Silent mutation</p><p>Explanation: In this mRNA strand, the first and last codons are different from the original DNA, but the amino acid sequence that they code for remains the same due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Therefore, this mutation does not change the resulting protein.</p><p></p><p>b. Type of mutation: Missense mutation</p><p>Explanation: In this mRNA strand, the second codon is changed from "T" to "A", resulting in a different amino acid being inserted at this position in the protein.</p><p></p><p>c. Type of mutation: Nonsense mutation</p><p>Explanation: In this mRNA strand, the first codon is missing, resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein.</p><p></p><p>2.</p><p>An insertion or deletion can cause a frameshift mutation. This means that all of the codons downstream from the insertion or deletion are shifted by one or more bases, changing the reading frame of the genetic code. This can result in a completely different amino acid sequence being produced, and often leads to nonfunctional or truncated proteins. Frameshift mutations are generally more severe than single base substitutions, as they affect multiple amino acids and can cause more drastic changes to the protein structure.</p><p></p><p>3.</p><p>AUG codes for: Methionine (start codon)</p><p>CCG codes for: Proline</p><p>GAU codes for: Aspartic acid</p><p>UAA codes for: Stop codon</p><br />

Abiotic factors include water, sunlight, oxygen, soil and temperature. Water (H2O) is a very important abiotic factor – it is often said that “water is life.” All living organisms need water.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kuha nlang po ng answer sa taas po</p><br />

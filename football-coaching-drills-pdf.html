                            5. the football team coach giving his last minute instructions to his players what type of speech style​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Formal Speech Style</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What distinguishes the formal speech style from the consultative style is the lack of listener participation. Unlike in interactions that use the consultative style, the listener does not participate, in most cases, in an interaction that requires the formal style. A formal style is often used in formal situations, such as in a graduation ceremony, an official meeting, a television newscast, and a conference, where there is only one-way communication. Since there is little or no feedback from the listeners or audience, the speaker needs to plan ahead of his or her utterances, or what he or she is going to say. Other characteristics of the formal style are:
</p><p>  </p><p>a. Interruptions are not allowed. Only the speaker is the source of information.
</p><p>b. Pronunciation is very clear.
</p><p>c. Words are carefully chosen, and grammar rules are followed.
</p><p>d. Sentence structures are more complex and varied.
</p><p>e. Extensive and technical vocabulary is required.
</p><p>f. Ideas are cohesive and organized.
</p><p>g. All background or necessary information is clearly given.
</p><p>This speech style is also used in sermons, speeches, and announcements. This is also the style that is used for academic and business writing.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Determine expected attendance and staff                                                                      2. Secure your venue</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Determine expected attendance and staff</p><p>No event can function without the correct amount of staff and volunteers. One of the main issues with larger sporting events is that they take place over multiple sites or routes—and this can be problematic, as you’ll need to enlist a large number of staff and volunteers to organize and manage each area.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that, as well as the event participants themselves, supporters will turn out in abundance—so even smaller-scale events can quickly become difficult to manage. This is where research will play a vital part. Spend time investigating past events to help gauge the turnout you can expect and ensure you have a large enough team to manage your event effectively.</p><p></p><p>Once you have a clear understanding of how many staff and volunteers you need, you’ll want to begin a recruitment process. Start by promoting your web-based volunteer registration page and signup form on your website and social channels to help attract volunteers to your event. Your event page not only provides a central space for volunteers to register, but it also allows anyone interested to post in the discussion section or message you directly. People will have questions, and you will be able to easily and publicly answer them. </p><p></p><p>2. Secure your venue</p><p>Until you have a site or venue locked down, you’ll be unable to progress with much of the planning—so make sure this is high on your list when it comes to getting organized. There’ll be a number of practicalities to take into consideration. Depending on the sport you are hosting, the number of venues in your area may be limited. For example, there may only be one or two gymnastics clubs with available space. In contrast, if you are hosting a soccer tournament, there may be a large number of fields to choose from. </p><p></p><p>Transportation is often one of the most tricky things to organize—so with the main venue secured, you’ll need to think about how people will get to and from your event as well as around the site(s) on the day in question. For example, do you need to contact the local authorities for permissions to close off an area of the city? This is the sort of thing you’ll need to think of with plenty of time to spare if you’re to get the sign-off you need ahead of your event.</p><br />

Enthusiastic.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>They jumped, which can mean many things but the context indicates that it was caused by enthusiasm. The term according to Oxford, is “having or showing intense and eager enjoyment, interest, or approval.” It's their first football game. Jumping doesn't suggest calmness, it's pretty much the opposite. If they were serious they wouldn't be jumping around all goofy and crazy. They'd be happy when they win; I argue that enthusiasm fits the situation better, aren't they excited about the match? Of course, unless they neglected to practice which I doubt. Sorry for the long essay.</p><br />

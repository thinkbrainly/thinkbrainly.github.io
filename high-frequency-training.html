In wave motion, the energy and the particles of the medium are transferred. 3. Amplitude is the distance between two crests. 4. Wavelength is the distance from one crest to the next trough. 5. Crests are the high points on a bwave. 6. Troughs are the low points on a wave. 7. The number of waves passing any point per second is the frequency. 8. Instead of troughs and crests, longitudinal waves have compressions and rarefactions. 9. Light waves are examples of transverse waves. 10. Examples of mechanical waves are microwaves and sound waves.please don't answer wr/ong, random, useless, sp/am, or if you don't know answer or I will ​REPORT</a>

                                            Frequency - How often or how many times per week you exerciseIs the number of times exercise is undertaken in a week. The more times a person exercisesthemore often their body is put under stress Exercising between three and five times a weekis the recommended amount to reach the minimum level of fitnessPhysical activity as part of your healthy, active lifestyle Top-class sports people haveto train a lot more frequently, often several sessions a day, but training very hard, every daycan also be harmful, even for a top-class athlete3Intensity - How hard you exercise (how fast you run or how much weight you lift)Is the level of difficulty of the exercise in cardiovascular training, working in a target zone of60 to 80 percent of the maximum heart rate is the level where fitness will usually increaseYour exercise intensity also depends on your level of training and it also depends onthe type of exercise you performing Exercise intensity is described as low, moderate, orhigh For example,Running intensitiesSlow pace - like a turtleModerate pace - like a dogFast pace - like a horseCONG• Weight lifting exercise intensitiesLight weightsModerate weightsVigorous weightsWhen training for strength the intensity is calculated in the same way. A person can trainwithin the target zone by finding the maximum weight they can lift and working to 60 to 80percent of that weightActive lifestyle as the amount of weight lifted increases with training, this will add to theintensityTime - How long you train (the amount of time you spend exercising)Refers to how long an exercise session last 30 minutes, to include a warm-up is therecommended length of a session in order to maintain good health and fitnessThe following are useful rules to follow in an exercise session1. Keep your pulse at 60 to 80 percent of its maximum for 20 minutes (the maximum can becalculated by using this formula: 220 - your age)2. Warming-up is not included in the 20 minutes3. The time begins when the pulse is at 60 percent of your maximumType - The kind of exercise you chooseRefers to the variety of training a performer undertakes. If general fitness is the aimit can be a matter of personal preference to suit the individualIf training for a specific event then less of a choice can be made, as the training shouldreflect the activity.

Strength activities, such as carrying groceries (or toddlers!), heavy yard work or weight training,strengthen musdes and bones and improve posture.14. An aerobic physical activity, such as running or biking, requires the same effort from everyone.15. In addition to aerobic and muscle and bone strengthening activities, it is also important toparticipate in flexibility activities.16. If you can't quite meet the physical activity guidelines, it is a waste of your time to do any physicalactivity17. It is not normal to have sore muscles after exercising.18.

Dehydration happens when the loss of body fluids, mostly water, exceeds the amount that is taken. 2. Eat foods with high amounts of carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables to avoid dehydration. 3. You are already dehydrated if you get thirsty. 4. Hypothermia occurs when the body is hard-pressed further than its limits during exhausting or extreme exercise, activity, heat, lack of water or food, and other causes 5. Overexertion can also be a factor of frequency, intensity, time, and type wherein training might be too frequent, intensity might be too hard, time might be too long, and type of exercise might be too much. 6. Do not give alcohol or caffeine to a person suffering from hypothermia. 7. If the victim of hypothermia is not exhausted, increase their heat production by getting them to exercise. 8. Hyperthermia is a result of the body being overheated. 9. Wearing a hat, preferably broad-brimmed to avoid exposure of your head in the heat, is one way to avoid hyperthermia. 10. Heat Exhaustion often happens to healthy people who are exposed to too much heat while working or exercising.​</a>

The more times a person exercisesthemore often their body is put under stress Exercising between three and five times a weekis the recommended amount to reach the minimum level of fitnessPhysical activity as part of your healthy, active lifestyle Top-class sports people haveto train a lot more frequently, often several sessions a day, but training very hard, every daycan also be harmful, even for a top-class athlete3Intensity - How hard you exercise (how fast you run or how much weight you lift)Is the level of difficulty of the exercise in cardiovascular training, working in a target zone of60 to 80 percent of the maximum heart rate is the level where fitness will usually increaseYour exercise intensity also depends on your level of training and it also depends onthe type of exercise you performing Exercise intensity is described as low, moderate, orhigh For example,Running intensitiesSlow pace - like a turtleModerate pace - like a dogFast pace - like a horseCONG• Weight lifting exercise intensitiesLight weightsModerate weightsVigorous weightsWhen training for strength the intensity is calculated in the same way. A person can trainwithin the target zone by finding the maximum weight they can lift and working to 60 to 80percent of that weightActive lifestyle as the amount of weight lifted increases with training, this will add to theintensityTime - How long you train (the amount of time you spend exercising)Refers to how long an exercise session last 30 minutes, to include a warm-up is therecommended length of a session in order to maintain good health and fitnessThe following are useful rules to follow in an exercise session1. Keep your pulse at 60 to 80 percent of its maximum for 20 minutes (the maximum can becalculated by using this formula: 220 - your age)2. Warming-up is not included in the 20 minutes3. The time begins when the pulse is at 60 percent of your maximumType - The kind of exercise you chooseRefers to the variety of training a performer undertakes. If general fitness is the aimit can be a matter of personal preference to suit the individualIf training for a specific event then less of a choice can be made, as the training shouldreflect the activity.

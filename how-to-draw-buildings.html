How manypeople are going to use the building at the same time? What types of activities willthese people do in the building? Also, architects consider the function of the buildingwhen designing a building. They have to design a building so that people canescape from the building in an emergency. In addition, architects also spend timecreatively thinking about how they want the building to look. The building must bepleasant to look at, comfortable to work in, and strong enough to be safe from mostnatural disasters.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>An architectural drawing or architect's drawing is a technical drawing of a building (or building project) that falls within the definition of architecture. Architectural drawings are used by architects and others for a number of purposes: to develop a design idea into a coherent proposal, to communicate ideas and concepts, to convince clients of the merits of a design, to assist a building contractor to construct it based on design intent, as a record of the design and planned development, or to make a record of a building that already exists.</p><br />

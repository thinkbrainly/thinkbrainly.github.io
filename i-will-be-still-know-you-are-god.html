                                            •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

                                            TASK 6: SUCCESS MONITOR- When other people said " Hindi ka makakatapos ng pag aaral KAsi mag boboyfriend ka lang nmn din" or  " Hindi ka makakatapos ng pag aaral KAsi mahirap lang kayo! ". Those words make me feel pain inside my heart, other people always sayings some hurtful words to me, to my family. But those words made me stand to continue what I have done right now,  those words made me stand to still continue to achieve my goal, my plans, my dreams to my family. All I need to do is to continue fighting all of my battles in my live. Even there is too many people making me down, but I will gain my dreams to my family I'll fight for them regarding to our situation right now, I will still fight because I know that God is with me. I am pretty sure that I'll become a successful someday we  just only  need to do a hard work, put Jesus in the center of all this things and also always believe in yourself that you become a successful someday in your own ways.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            20. Can you get pregnant from sperm in the bucket of water?I masturbated in the bathroom and I don't know if there are sperm on the bucket water, I get my period for consecutive 2 months but it's light flow and I'm still scared because my pregnancy symptoms doesn't go away and it's getting stronger.I am suicidal now, please help me.I only do inserted my finger for 5 seconds nothing else, I can't get pregnant just by that.I'm 17. and single.I used the bathroom right after my brother used it.Oh God, how I wished I am not really pregnant because if I do...no ones gonna believe me and I might end up commiting a sin.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>No, you cannot get pregnant from sperm in a bucket of water. Sperm can only survive in a very narrow range of temperatures and conditions, and a bucket of water is not a suitable environment for them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sperm is a delicate and fragile cell, and requires specific temperatures and conditions in order to survive. If the environment is too cold or too hot, or if the pH or salt levels are not balanced, the sperm will die. A bucket of water is not a suitable environment for sperm to survive, as it is not at the right temperature, nor has the right pH or salt levels. Therefore, it is not possible to get pregnant from sperm in a bucket of water.</p><br />

                            26. •	Title of the Book: The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks
•	Excerpt:
	Afterward I sit in the chair that has come to be shaped like me. They are finishing up now; her clothes are on, but still she is crying. It will become quieter after they leave, I know. The excitement of the morning always upsets her, and today is no exception. Finally the shade is opened and the nurses walk out. Both of them touch me and smile as they walk by. I wonder what this means.
I sit for just a second and stare at her, but she doesn't return the look. I understand, for she doesn't know who I am. I'm a stranger to her. Then, turning away, I bow my head and pray silently for the strength I know I will need. I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for a list of questions I definitely want answered after I'm gone.
Ready now. On go the glasses, out of my pocket comes a magnifier. I put it on the table for a moment while I open the notebook. It takes two licks on my gnarled finger to get the well-worn cover open to the first page. Then I put the magnifier in place.
There is always a moment right before I begin to read the story when my mind churns, and I wonder, Will it happen today? I don't know, for I never know beforehand, and deep down it really doesn't matter. It's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. And though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things. So once again, just as I do every day, I begin to read the notebook aloud, so that she can hear it, in the hope that the miracle that has come to dominate my life will once again prevail.
And maybe, just maybe, it will.

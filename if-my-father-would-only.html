                                            Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</a>

He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?</a>

Upon rapid test, his result is negative that's why he underwent home quarantine only. The room where he stayed was a square- shaped. The area of the room is (4x+12x+9) square feet. How long is the side of his quarantined room? Express your answer as binomial. If x= 1(ft). how long is its side? What is the room area? Would it be conducive for his father to stay in the room?

Who helpsthem dress when they arise?”"None, sir. Would you have them take off their garment and sleep without them—like beasts?”“Their garment! Have they but one?”"Ah, your lordship, what would they do with more?”"It is a quaint and marvelous thought! I beg your pardon, I had not meant to laugh. Youspeak well and have an easy grace. Do you go to school?”"No, sir, but the kind priest, Father Andrew, taught me from his books."“Tell me of your Offal Court. Do you have a pleasant life there?”“Yes, sir, except when one is hungry.”"Tell me more.”“We boys of Offal Court run races to see who the fastest of us is.”“I'd like to do that, too.""In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river. We dive and shout andtumble and—”“It would be worth my father's kingdom to enjoy it once! Please go on.”“We dance and sing about the Maypole. We play in the sand. We wallow in the mud, sir.”“Oh, it's glorious! If I could only wear clothes like yours, and strip my feet, and revel inthe mud once, just once.""And if I could only clothe me once, sweet sir, as you are clothed, just once—”“Oh, would you like it? Then so shall it be. Take off your rags and wear my splendidclothes, boy! Let's change before anybody comes.”A few minutes later, the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's fluttering oddsand ends. The little Prince of Pauperdom was dressed in the gaudy plumage of royalty. Thetwo went and stood side by side before a great mirror. A miracle! They stared at each other,then at the mirror, and then at each other again. At last the puzzled prince said, “What do youthink of this?"​</a>

                                            The Prodigal Son Luke 15: 11-32 A man had two sons. One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</a>

I spent the rest of my high schoolyears wondering whether I would actually be living up to his expectations. It was a sillythought, but there were times that it was the only thing that I would think about. It wascrippling, the way I viewed the world. I was stuck with this feeling that nothing I wasdoing was good enough and that I'd never live up to his standards. There were weeks itwould keep me up all night, crying out for an answer that I'd never find. It started gettingbetter after I got professional help. I came to accept that I might not live up to hisexpectations, but that was 0.K., so long as I was proud of my accomplishments.​</a>

He thought to himself," It will take Mother and Father some time at the market. I will play first then come back to do my chores." Then off he ran to play with his friends outside. Isidro enjoyed playing so much. He did not notice Father and Mother had already arrived. He only hurried hone after Alex had called him. "So, only Alex did what he was asked to do," Father said. "Well, that means only Alex gets to play for the rest of the day. While you, Isidro, will finish your chores and stay home the rest of the day."Isidro felt bad, but he knew his parents were right. He promised to himself that whenever he has work to do, he will do it promptly and do it wellAnswer 1. Which of the boys used his time wisely? 2. Was Mr. Felipe right in punishing Isidro?

                                            THE CENTIPEDE by Rony V. Diaz My sister was the meanest creature I knew. She was eight when I was born, the day my mother died. Although we continued to live in the same house, she had gone, it seemed, to another country from where she looked at me with increasing amoyance and contempt. Nothing I did ever pleased her. She destroyed willfully anything I liked. I learned how to hold myself because I knew we had to put up with her whims to keep her calm and quiet. She had a weak heart and she must not be surprised. But when she dumped my butterflies into a waste can and burned them in the backyard, I realized that she was spiting me. My butterflies never snickerad at her and they did not smell. I kept them in an unused cabinet in the living room and unless she opened the drawers, they were out of her sight. And she knew too that my butterfly collection had grown with me. But when I arrived home, one afternoon, from school, I found my butterflies in a can, burned in their cotton beds like deckle. I wept and Father had to call my sister for an explanation. She stood straight and calm before Father, but my tear-logged eyes saw only her harsh and arrogant silhouette. She looked at me curiously, but she did not say anything, and Father began gently to question her. She listened politely and when Father had stopped talking, she said without rush, heat or concern: --They were attracting ants.

                                            A father told his three sons he would die soon and he needed to decide which one of them to give his property to. He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?

"I'll eat a bigbreakfast before i prepare my seed beds. I'll close my eyes when I sow the palay seedsso that no one will see where the seeds fall. I won't let birds go near my field. I'll followfaithfully what our father and forefathers practiced and believed in. I suppose I'll havea very big harvest."I'll gather the palay seeds myself," said Andres. I'll pick only the biggest and fullestheads. I'll fertilize my field first. I'll sow the seeds with my eyes open, but when Itransplant, I'll plant them 25 centimeters apart.I'll spray my field with insecticide whennecessary. I'll make use of the scientific practices I've read from books."Source: Developing Reading Power by Capili Ferrer Condez Logue BagabaldoQUESTIONS:Answer the following questions on your notebook1.

                            5. Of More Value By Jerry B Jenkins A friend, a father of two daughters, admits he does not mind putting a line fear into the boys trying to have a date with his daughter. His daughters are sometimes embarrassed when their father asks for a few moments alone with their date, and he would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy that he is a mean, protective father to his daughters Besides, he believes that there is no such thing as being overprotective. Another friend says he uses sports analogy to get his point across He would tell the boy, "If I owned the most expensive, exotic sports cars on the road and I let you take it for a spin, you'd be careful with it wouldn't you?" "Oh yes, Sir, you bet. " "You'd treat it better than it was your own wouldn't you?" "Yes, Sir." "I wouldn't want to think you were screeching the tires, would 17 "No. Sir" "Well, let me tell you something, just so we're straight with each other, man to man My daughter is of infinitively more value to me than any car could be. Do you got my drift? She's on loan from me to you for the next few hours and I wouldnt want to discover that she's treated with any less care or respect that I would give here. I'm responsible for her. She's mine. Im entrusting her to you. That trust gives no second chance Understood?" By then, of course, the young man is wondering why he didn't ask someone else out. He's only nodding, unable to speak Most often, he brings the gat home earlier than promised. The daughter might even complain about her father's approach, but deep down, she feels loved and cherished and you can be sure she'll marry a man who treats her that way C. DEVELOPING THE SKILLS Read the questions carefully and write your answers below. 1. How does the first father show he values his daughter? 2. How does the sports analogy of the second father affect the boy asking permission to date his daughter? 3. Which of the two fathers do you think has a better approach to their daughters' suitors?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The first father shows that he values his daughter by being protective of her and trying to scare off potential suitors who might not treat her well. He would rather have the young men think he is not an okay guy than not being a mean, protective father to his daughters.</p><p>2. The sports analogy of the second father puts pressure on the boy asking permission to date his daughter by suggesting that the father's daughter is of infinite more value than any car, and that the boy must treat her with the same care and respect as he would the father's sports car.</p><p>3. Both fathers have their own approaches, but the second father's approach may be more effective in getting his point across and making sure that the boy understands the responsibility he is taking on when asking to date his daughter.</p><br />

                            6. A father told his three sons he would die soon and he needed to decide which one of them to give his property to. He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?</h2><br />

                            9. The Prodigal Son Luke 15: 11-32 A man had two sons. One day, the younger of the two demanded the share of his father's property that would belong to him when his father died. His father gave it to him, and after a few days, the boy left home on a long journey Here, he wasted the money and lived a wild life. When the money was all spent, there came a famine, and he began to be in serious need. He found some work in looking after the pigs of a farmer in that district. But there was nothing he could eat except what the pigs ate. At last, he was so hungry and so hopeless that he started to consider who he was and what sort of person he had become. He saw that he was poorer than the poorest of his father's servants. Then he decided to return home. He planned to admit that he had done wrong and to ask his father to employ him as a servant, since he could not expect to be treated as a son any longer So, he made the long journey home. But before he could reach the house, his father saw him. He saw the boy's misery and ran down the road and welcomed him with affection. The boy began to speak of the wrong that he had done, but before he could ask to be employed as a servant, his father called for a rove of honor and put it on him. Then he gave him a ring and sandals to show that he was fully accepted as his son, and a feast was prepared so that everyone could share in his father's joy. The other son had been working on the farm. As he returned to the house, he heard the singing and the hand clapping, and asked what had happened. His father came out and begged him to join in the feast. But he said, "I have worked for you for years, yet you never made a feast for me. Now you welcome this son of yours who had wasted your money!" Then his father said gently, "My boy, of course we must welcome him home. He is not only 'my son' as you call him; he is your brother. Come inside and share my joy. The one that was lost has now been found." write summary in your answer sheet ​</h2><br />

She destroyed willfully anything I liked. I learned how to hold myself because I knew we had to put up with her whims to keep her calm and quiet. She had a weak heart and she must not be surprised. But when she dumped my butterflies into a waste can and burned them in the backyard, I realized that she was spiting me. My butterflies never snickerad at her and they did not smell. I kept them in an unused cabinet in the living room and unless she opened the drawers, they were out of her sight. And she knew too that my butterfly collection had grown with me. But when I arrived home, one afternoon, from school, I found my butterflies in a can, burned in their cotton beds like deckle. I wept and Father had to call my sister for an explanation. She stood straight and calm before Father, but my tear-logged eyes saw only her harsh and arrogant silhouette. She looked at me curiously, but she did not say anything, and Father began gently to question her. She listened politely and when Father had stopped talking, she said without rush, heat or concern: --They were attracting ants.

Is it appropriate for Delia to blame her brother of their mother's death? Why, why not? 2. If you are her sibling, how would you react when you discovered that she burned your butterfly collection?PAKI SAGOT PO KAILANGAN KOPO NOW EH PASSING NA KASI ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. It's not appropriate for Delia to blame her brother of their mother's death but then we all have different ways of coping for our loss. Maybe it is Delia's way of coping from losing her mother at an early age still it's not right to blame her brother for something he didn't do.</p><p></p><p>2. I might be angry at her but will definitely not say violent words to her. It's okay to feel angry if someone messes with your things. I will be angry at her for a short while and after that I will try to think logically. Maybe she's still coping from our mother's death but her actions should never be tolerated, she should learn her lesson.</p><p></p><p>pa-mark nlang po ng brainliest if satisfied, correct my grammar nalang din po kung may mali. thank u po</p><br />

                            24. A father told his three sons he would die soon and he needed to decide which one of them to give his property to. He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?

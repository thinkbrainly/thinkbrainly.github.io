                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Often women served as spies and they helped in the recruitment of new members into the organization. Most women played a supportive role. Melchora Aquino is an exemplary model. At an advanced age, Melchora volunteered to help the Katipunan.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Humiliation</strong></p><p>Because cyberbullying occurs in cyberspace, online bullying feels permanent. Kids know that once something is out there, it will always be out there. They can feel exposed, embarrassed, and overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>When cyberbullying occurs, the nasty posts, messages, or texts can be shared with multitudes of people. The sheer volume of people that know about the bullying can lead to intense feelings of humiliation.1</p><p></p><p><strong>Isolation</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying sometimes causes kids to be excluded and ostracized at school. Consequently, they often feel alone and isolated.1 This experience can be particularly painful because friends are crucial at this age. When kids don’t have friends, this can lead to more bullying. </p><p></p><p>When cyberbullying occurs, parents sometimes recommend shutting off the computer or turning off the cell phone. But for many kids, using these devices is considered the most important way they communicate with others. Turning them off often means cutting off their connection with their world, which can make them feel more secluded.</p><p></p><p><strong>Powerless</strong></p><p>Victims of cyberbullying often find it difficult to feel safe. They may feel vulnerable and powerless. Typically, these feelings surface because the online bullying can invade their home through a computer or cell phone at any time of day. They no longer have a place where they can escape.1</p><p></p><p>To a victim, it can feel like cyberbullying is everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, because the bullies can remain anonymous, this realization may escalate feelings of fear.1 Sometimes kids who are targeted may have no idea who is inflicting the pain, although some cyberbullies choose people they know and have no problem identifying themselves.</p><p></p><p> Cyberbullies Who Target People They Know</p><p>Mental Effects of Cyberbullying</p><p>When cyberbullying is ongoing, victims may relate to the world around them differently than others. For many, life can feel hopeless and meaningless.1</p><p></p><p>They may lose interest in things they once enjoyed and spend less time interacting with family and friends. And, in some cases, depression and thoughts of suicide can set in.</p><p></p><p><strong>Depression </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>anxiety</strong></p><p>Victims of cyberbullying may succumb to anxiety, depression, and other stress-related conditions. The added stress of coping with cyberbullying on a regular basis can steal their feelings of happiness and contentment. It also can increase feelings of worry and isolation.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying also can erode self-confidence and feelings of self-worth, which can contribute to depression and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Research has consistently supported the notion that increasing levels of cyberbullying lead to higher levels of depression. In fact, one study found that 93% of those victimized by cyberbullying reported feelings of sadness, powerlessness, and hopelessness.1﻿﻿</p><p></p><p><strong>Low</strong> <strong>Self-Esteem</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying often zeros in on what already makes victims feel most vulnerable. For example, maybe a child who feels insecure about a birthmark ends up being bullied about just that.</p><p></p><p>Even when that's not the case, though, online bullying can have an impact on self-esteem. Targets of bullying may begin to feel intense dissatisfaction with who they are. As a result, they can begin to doubt their worth and value.</p><p></p><p>Researchers speculate that because young people have an intense psychological need to be part of and accepted by a peer group, cyberbullying may cause psychological maladjustment, reduced well-being, and ultimately low self-esteem.3</p><p></p><p><strong>Academic</strong> <strong>Issues</strong></p><p>Kids being victimized by cyberbullying may lose interest in school. As a result, they often have much higher rates of absenteeism than non-bullied kids. They may skip school to avoid facing the kids cyberbullying them or because they are embarrassed and humiliated by the messages that were shared online.</p><p></p><p>Their grades may also suffer because they find it difficult to concentrate or study. And in some cases, kids may either drop out of school or lose interest in continuing their education after high school.4</p><p></p><p><strong>Suicidal</strong> <strong>Thoughts</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Self-Harm</strong></p><p>Sometimes targets of cyberbullying respond to their intense feelings by harming themselves in some way. For instance, some might engage in self-harm such as cutting or burning themselves. In fact, research has consistently linked bullying and self-harm.</p><p></p><p>3. Previous research has suggested that long term separation, from parents or parent, has the following adverse effects: depression, loneliness, anxiety, anger, behavioral problems at school, low academic achievement motivation, lack of self-esteem, misbehavior, truancy, and stealing</p><p></p><p>4.(di ko na alam lods)</p><p></p><p>5.</p><p></p><p>6.</p><p></p><p>7.</p><p></p><p>8.</p><p></p><p>9.</p><p></p><p>10.</p><p></p><p>(di ko na alam ibaaa, senya na lods)</p><p></p><p></p><br />

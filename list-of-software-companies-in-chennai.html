"Ngayon sa bowling sina Rashid at Noor, alam namin na makakalaban namin ang mga batters tulad ni (Cameron) Green at (Tim) David na gusto ang bilis sa bola."Nangunguna ang Gujarat at Chennai Super Kings sa halfway stage dahil may 10 puntos ang magkabilang koponan. Ang Mumbai ay may anim na puntos at ikapito." Ano ang aral na makukuha sa balitang ito?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:1639</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:Fort St. George (or historically, White Town[1]) is the first English (later British) fortress in India, founded in 1639[2] at the coastal city of Madras, the modern city of Chennai. The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.[3] Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city evolved around the fortress.[4] The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. "AHMEDABAD, India (AP) — Tinalo ng defending champion Gujarat Titans ang Mumbai Indians ng 55 run sa Indian Premier League noong Martes at naging unang koponan na nagdepensa sa kabuuan sa Narendra Modi Stadium ngayong season.Nangunguna si Shubman Gill na may 56 ngunit ito ay palaban na natamaan nina David Miller (46) at Abhinav Manohar (42) sa death overs na nakakuha sa Gujarat ng pinakamataas na kabuuang IPL na 207-6.Binaklas ng Afghan spin duo na sina Noor Ahmad (3-37) at Rashid Khan (2-27) ang middle-order ng Mumbai bago ang quickfire ni Nehal Wadhera na 40 sa 21 na bola ay nagtapos sa Mumbai sa 152-9."Ang pagkakapitan ay isang bagay kung saan palagi kong pinatalbog ang aking instinct," sabi ni Gujarat skipper Hardik Pandya. "Ngayon sa bowling sina Rashid at Noor, alam namin na makakalaban namin ang mga batters tulad ni (Cameron) Green at (Tim) David na gusto ang bilis sa bola."Nangunguna ang Gujarat at Chennai Super Kings sa halfway stage dahil may 10 puntos ang magkabilang koponan. Ang Mumbai ay may anim na puntos at ikapito." Ano ang aral na makukuha sa balitang ito?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang aral na makukuha sa balitang ito ay tungkol sa tagumpay ng Gujarat Titans at sa kanilang pagdepensa sa kabuuan sa Narendra Modi Stadium ngayong season ng Indian Premier League. Ipinakita ng koponan ang pagsasama-sama, mga kasanayan sa paglalaro, at pagkakapitan. Sinabi rin ng kapitan ng Gujarat na mahalaga ang pagkakapitan sa bola dahil ito ay humahantong sa karagdagang tagumpay. Naging mahalaga rin ang ginamit na bowlers ng Gujarat na sina Noor Ahmad at Rashid Khan upang mapigilan ang middle-order ng Mumbai Indians. Ang mga kagamitan sa paglalaro ng cricket ay hindi nabanggit sa balita, kaya walang direktang koneksyon sa mga naitalang regalo sa punto ng view na yun.</p><p></p><p><strong>alternative answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Ang aral na mapupulot mula sa balitang ito ay tungkol sa halaga ng pagkakaisa at pagkakapitan sa pag-abot ng tagumpay sa anumang larangan. Ipinakita ng Gujarat Titans na sa pamamagitan ng pagsasama-sama at pagkakapitan, kahit na laban sila sa isang malakas na koponan gaya ng Mumbai Indians, ay maaaring magtagumpay. Mahalaga rin ang pagpili ng tamang kagamitan at mga kasangkapang gagamitin upang makamit ang layuning ito.</p><br />

</p><p>María Clara
</p><p>Padre Dámaso
</p><p>Capitán Tiago
</p><p>Elías</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin , commonly called Ibarra, is Filipino-Spanish and the only descendant of the wealthy Spaniard Don Rafael Ibarra. He was born and grew up in the Philippines, but during his adolescence, spent seven years studying in Europe. </p><p></p><p>María Clara de Los Santos y Alba, is the most dominant yet weakest representation of women in the setting. When thinking of Noli, the name of María Clara can be seen predominantly as the image of the ideal Filipino woman. </p><p>Dámaso Verdolagas (commonly known as Padre Dámaso/Padre Damaso or Father Damaso), of Franciscan order, was the former curate of the parish church of San Diego. He was the curate for almost twenty years before he was replaced by the much younger Padre Salvi.</p><p>Don Santíago de los Santos, commonly known as Kapitán Tiago, is the only son of a wealthy trader in Malabon. Due to his mother's cruelty, Kapitán Tiago did not attain any formal education. He became a servant of a Dominican priest.</p><p>Don Anastacio, commonly known as Filósofo Tacio (Philosopher Tasyo) is one of the most important characters in Noli. On the one hand, he is referred to as a philosopher/sage (hence, Pilosopo Tasyo) because his ideas were accurate with the minds of the townspeople. </p><p>Eliás came from the family which the Ibarra clan had oppressed for generations. He grew up in a wealthy family until he discovered something that changed his life forever. Despite that Ibarra's family subjugated his family, he is entirely indebted towards him. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

It is a re-telling of an episode from the Maranao epic legend Darangen involving the rescue of Princess Gandingan (abducted by diwata) by the legendary Prince Bantugan.</strong><strong>Singkil (or Sayaw sa Kasingkil) is a famous dance of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao, which was popularized by the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company. ... Singkil means to entangle the feet with disturbing objects such as vines or anything in your path.</strong><strong>(Maranao, Mindanao) Coming from the Lake Lanao region, the Singkil is a popular dance performed during celebrations and other festive entertainment. Performed as a female only dance, the Singkil serves as either a conscious or unconscious advertisement to would-be suitors for her future marriage.</strong><strong>Singkil is a Mindanao folk dance that originated from the Maranao people and is based on the story in the Darangen, the pre-Islamic Maranao interpretation of the ancient Hindu Indian epic, the Ramayana.</strong><strong>The female lead dancer plays the role of Princess Gandingan of the Darangen epic, wearing the heavy rings around her ankles to keep time while she dances. In an episode of the Maranao epic, the princess is caught in the middle of the forest during an earthquake caused by the diwatas (or the guardian spirits) of the Kingdom of Bumbaran.[2] The diwatas abducted the princess and entrapped her into a forest to teach the philandering Prince Bantugan a lesson.[2][3] The falling trees during the earthquake (which the princess gracefully avoids) are represented by the bamboo poles arranged in a criss-crossed fashion and clacked together in a unique, syncopated rhythm. During the performance, the female lead dancer graciously steps in and out of the bamboo poles as she manipulates two elaborately designed fans called apir. Another female dancer represents the loyal slave of the princess who accompanies her throughout the ordeal. After a while, a male dancer, representing the legendary Prince Bantugan of the Darangen epic, performs his dance round and through the bamboo poles clacked together bearing a shield and a sword. The entrance of the male dancer symbolizes the arrival of Prince Bantugan who is determined to rescue the princess from the diwatas. Other dancers skillfully manipulate the apir fans, which represent the winds which prove to be auspicious. The dance steps require agile movement so that the dancer's feet won't be crushed by the moving bamboos.

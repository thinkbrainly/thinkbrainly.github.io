                            7. PLAN IN MY FAMILY IN FUTURE</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Live like we mean it today.
</p><p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but it’s not. Jesus told a great story about a man who spent every waking hour accumulating things for the future and building increasingly bigger sheds to put it all in. Unfortunately, he never got to see ’20 years into the future.’ If we’re careful to live like we mean it today, then we’re building a solid foundation for years.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Practice balance.
</p><p>Wisdom is not having to go to the store for milk right before breakfast. Living like we mean it today includes appropriate planning for tomorrow. Today balanced with tomorrow, family relationships balanced against making a living. Find that balance because it won’t find you.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Spend less than you earn—every month.
</p><p>This is a simple guideline with complex repercussions. Digging out of debt is like building a wall with dry sand—more than half of each shovel load comes right back down. First, stabilize your spending. Second, pay off the debt. Remember that you will pay more interest on your debt than you can earn from your savings. Now you can build for the future.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Invest yourself in your children.
</p><p>Here’s the math (don’t worry, it’s fairly painless!). Parental neglect to your five-year-old + a couple of years = 40% of the child’s life. But if you turn things around now, by the time he’s ten you’ll have been the world’s best dad forever. The more years we let slip away, the deeper in the hole relationships become. It is like negative interest compounded daily. Simply put, today is the right time to be a great dad. You’ll have that investment 20 years down the road and in spades.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Make the tough choices today.
</p><p>– Don’t say, “I’ll spend time with my kids next year…,” invest in family time today.
</p><p>
</p><p>– Don’t deal with your distant relationship with your wife “once we’ve got the kids settled in school…,” face the music before the damage solidifies.
</p><p>
</p><p>– Don’t say, “we’ll take care of us, the budget or our priorities after the kids go to college…,” bite the bullet now.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Love your wife eloquently.
</p><p>Too many parents neglect one another in favor of the kids. Big mistake. Your best gift to your children today is to love their mother. If you’re divorced, handle that one by offering respect and support. No matter how old the kids are today they’ll be young adults in 20 years. Two decades of love and respect are the best preparation for whatever’s in store around 2033.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. Build memories that will make you smile.
</p><p>This is a direct offshoot of 1-5 above. We may or may not live in this neighborhood, at this income level, or in this physical health in twenty years, but our family will have these memories to last a lifetime.
</p><p>
</p><p>8. Never give up (No Ordinary Family).
</p><p>Ordinary families struggle. Struggle is part of the definition of life, but you can be no ordinary family too. It’s how we respond to challenges that determines what the family looks like twenty years from now. For family, faithfulness is more than just a physical discipline—it’s a modus operandi. This is teaching our children well.
</p><p>
</p><p>“In families, time accelerates as it moves forward. Tomorrow is never a substitute for today.”
</p><p>9. Always believe.
</p><p>Family is first conceived in the context of promise. Belief in the power (and the value) of promise is a critical element of living in the light. However, belief is seldom written in indelible ink, it needs to be re-etched—deliberately, repeatedly, and together.
</p><p>
</p><p>10. Re-learn how to tell time.
</p><p>Analog? Digital? 24-hour? Greenwich-Mean-Time? None of the above? Chronological time is not what it appears to be. Family time is not that simple, either. In families, time accelerates as it moves forward. Tomorrow is never a substitute for today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps!

I know that these experiences have shaped me into the person I am today, and they have given me the strength and resilience to face whatever lies ahead.</p><p></p><p>I know that the years to come will bring new challenges and trials, but I also know that I am capable of overcoming them. I believe in myself, and I know that I have what it takes to achieve my goals. I may not always make the right decisions or face the right direction, but I know that I have the ability to learn from my mistakes and grow from them.</p><p></p><p>In addition to keeping my sense of wonder, I also want to remember to be patient and kind to myself. I know that life can be both fleeting and unpredictable, and I don't want to waste my time beating myself up over past mistakes or stressing about the future. Instead, I want to learn to appreciate the present moment and celebrate all the joys and adventures that life has to offer.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Hope it helps :)</strong></p><p></p><br />

As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be. Completing this the personal career development plan will not only help me see my goals on paper but will give me something to look back on when I have acquired all the goals I set to accomplish.</p><br />

                            28. my education my contribution to the future.essay pake answer po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My gift to the future is my education. I have no knowledge of politics or economics. Political activism is what I do. The government doesn't interest me. My education was useless, and neither the books I studied nor the lessons I acquired from my college students counted. My political education was limited to a university course on "Socialism and Capitalism" that I took with a group of middle- and upper-class individuals from what I refer to as the Third World. In the end, I think I entered the Second World. I continue to support anarchism. The issue with anarchism is that it is built on a sort of idealistic illusion and that it will not function if it is founded on something like communism. To be able to live in peace with a new and different society, in which to spend my life and in which I am free to act on what I want, however, will destroy an entire generation of anarchists. I wished to improve myself. I want individuals who aspire to improve themselves. I aspired to write more effectively. I'm curious as to what it would take to alter a culture that, in reality, fails miserably. I want to improve myself as a person. I'd rather not go to work. I want to be a better person than my parents, not to take over their position or whatever they call themselves. Unlike the other wealthy individuals, who believe that everything revolves around one person not having to exist.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps </p><p>#carryonlearning</p><br />

First of all, animals provide humans with food for example cows and chicken. Secondly they can be used for protection for example dogs and also to aid the handicapped. Animals like horses and donkeys are used as a means of transportation and for recreation activities like racing. Lastly, animals can be used as companions to humans. They are known as pets and most people value them so much such that they even end up giving them a respectful burial in a pet cemetery after they die. This forms our discussion for today (Hartsdale Pet Cemetery) which is the final resting place for nearly 70,000 pets including dogs, cats, birds, rabbits and even a lion cub (Waldau, 2011).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

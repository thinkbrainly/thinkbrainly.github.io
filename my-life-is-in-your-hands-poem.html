If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</a>

                                            Ballad of a Mother’s Heart
Jose LaVilla Tierra
The night was dark, for the moon was young
And the stars were asleep and rare;
The clouds were thick, yet Youth went out
To see his Maiden fair.
“Dear One,” he pleaded as he knelt
Before her feet, in tears,
“My love is true; why have you kept
Me waiting all these years?”
The maiden looked at him unmoved,
It seemed, and whispered low:
“Persistent Youth, you have to prove
By deeds your love is true.”
“There’s not a thing I would not do
For you, Beloved,” said he.
“Then go,” said she, “to your mother dear
And bring her heart to me.”
Without another word,
Youth left and went to his mother dear.
And opened her breast and took her heart.
He did not shed a tear!
Then back to his Maiden fair he ran,
Unmindful of the rain;
But his feet slipped and he fell down
And loud he groaned with pain!
Still in his hand he held the prize
That would win his Maiden’s hand;
And he thought of his mother dear
So kind, so sweet, so fond.
And then he heard a voice,
Not from his lips but all apart:
“Get up,” it said; “Were you hurt, Child?”
It was his mother’s heart.

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

                                            In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

Setting SpotlightH. RecommendationsPARAGRAPHS1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</a>

                                            I Can Be A Star By Ma Rita N. Santiana "I can do this". This is my motto whenever things get bard because I believe that God is with me. "Come, let's practice, I called my friend Armand one late afternoon after our English class. He called other participants to proceed to the school gymnasium. Each one took his assigned place and started reciting the first stanza of the poem. Then, the second and so on until we successfully finished reciting the entire piece. "Good job, children! You can win this," Miss Villanueva, our English teacher commented How did Miss Villanueva motivate the children to give their best? I could still recall one of the most challenging moments in my life three years ago when I got sick of dengue. Nobody could tell that I can survive that time. But because I offered everything to God, I have nothing to worry. That moment made me realize that only in His hands can I be sure that I can be a star and will continue to shine even in the midst of darkness. If you are the narrator in the story, will you entrust everything to God? Why? Why not? Did you enjoy the story? Ponder on the most challenging moment in your life. How did you overcome it?

                                            What's New Below is a simple poem about the life of a virtual gamer. Read the lines carefully and use your imagination as you move from one line to another. Answer briefly the questions that tells about how the gamer uses his body The Virtual Gamer by: Von RJ Josol I play the game from morning 'til night Never miss the chance to win the fight For I am destined to withstand the game I aim for victory and fame! I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever. Because you can never win your battle, if your body is gone. For a virtual gamer checks his facts more than ever. Question How will your body react if you do not eat food and drink water in a day? 10​</a>

                                            (Analyze a Particular Point of View:)
Freedom
Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland!
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future;
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,
where movements are started through brainless wires,
repeated through mindless habits,
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
master of show,
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</h2><br />

                            15. Ballad of a Mother’s Heart
Jose LaVilla Tierra
The night was dark, for the moon was young
And the stars were asleep and rare;
The clouds were thick, yet Youth went out
To see his Maiden fair.
“Dear One,” he pleaded as he knelt
Before her feet, in tears,
“My love is true; why have you kept
Me waiting all these years?”
The maiden looked at him unmoved,
It seemed, and whispered low:
“Persistent Youth, you have to prove
By deeds your love is true.”
“There’s not a thing I would not do
For you, Beloved,” said he.
“Then go,” said she, “to your mother dear
And bring her heart to me.”
Without another word,
Youth left and went to his mother dear.
And opened her breast and took her heart.
He did not shed a tear!
Then back to his Maiden fair he ran,
Unmindful of the rain;
But his feet slipped and he fell down
And loud he groaned with pain!
Still in his hand he held the prize
That would win his Maiden’s hand;
And he thought of his mother dear
So kind, so sweet, so fond.
And then he heard a voice,
Not from his lips but all apart:
“Get up,” it said; “Were you hurt, Child?”
It was his mother’s heart.

2. What did the maiden ask of the young man to prove his love for her? Why do you think she
did this?

===============================
3. What kind of a son is the young man?

===============================
4. How great is the love of the mother?

5. What is the purpose of the author in writing the poem? What message does he want to
convey?
Answer:
===============================
6. Cite some real-life events you know showing the great love of a mother.
Answer:
===============================</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>The young man is described as a persistent suitor who is deeply in love with the maiden. He pleads with her and expresses his love as true.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. </strong>The maiden asks the young man to bring her the heart of his mother to prove his love for her. It's not clear why she would ask for such a task, but it may suggest that she wants to see the depth of his devotion and willingness to make sacrifices for her.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. </strong>Based on the poem, it is suggested that the young man is a dutiful son who loves and respects his mother. He does not hesitate to carry out the request of the maiden and takes his mother's heart without shedding a tear, implying that he is willing to do whatever it takes to prove his love for the maiden.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. </strong>The love of the mother is shown to be great, as her heart still calls out to her son even after it has been removed from her body.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. </strong>The purpose of the author in writing the poem is unclear. However, the message that he may want to convey is the idea of sacrifice and devotion in love. The poem raises questions about the lengths that one might go to prove their love and the consequences of such actions.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. </strong>There are many real-life events that show the great love of a mother, such as a mother sacrificing her own comfort and well-being to care for her children, a mother going to great lengths to protect her child from harm, or a mother making financial sacrifices to provide for her family. These examples demonstrate the selflessness and unconditional love that a mother has for her children.</p><br />

How do you scale down your love? Give examples.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The poetic persona of the poem is not explicitly stated, but it is likely the author herself, Edith Tiempo.The line that is repeated in the first and second stanza is "All that I love". The difference in meaning between the two is that in the first stanza, it seems to be a rhetorical question, while in the second stanza, it is being affirmed that all the things mentioned are indeed things that the speaker loves.The line "Till seashells are broken pieces/From God's own bright teeth" implies that even the smallest and seemingly insignificant things in life are evidence of God's great love. This is seen in the beauty and intricacy of seashells, which are created by God. Examples of stories that affirm God's love could include the story of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity or the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.Love is being portrayed as something that is cherished and valued, and that can be kept and treasured in small, physical objects.In the third stanza, the speaker mentions scaling down love to emphasize the importance of keeping memories and cherished objects in a compact and tangible form. Scaling down love allows the speaker to keep all that she loves with her at all times, making it easier to remember and cherish the memories associated with those objects. Scaling down love can be done in different ways depending on the individual. For example, keeping sentimental items in a small box or container, carrying a locket or other small keepsake, or even just taking photographs of special moments or objects can help scale down love into something tangible and manageable.<p></p><br />

My Life is in Your Hands (From a client's perspective)
by: Stephanie Griffey
I did not choose this life or these struggles that I face
And I don’t know how I got here to such a vulnerable state.
Everyone is quick to judge me yet they offer no help.
Can’t they see I’m alone here? I’m doing this by myself.
Maybe I’ve made some mistakes but I did not ask for this.
I don’t know how to get out now. These walls are caving in.
The world seems so big and the possibilities so small.
There’s no room to breathe here, no one to catch my fall.
So here I stand, no way to cope.
I’ve come to you, my last source of hope.
Please tell me you have an answer to end the hunger and the pain.
Tell me you can help me to finally live again.
Is there light at the horizon; are there brighter days for me?
I stand at your mercy; do you hear this humble plea?
Can you feed my children and give them care?
Can you give me direction in this world out there?
Can you save me from myself and heal me inside?
Can you explain this hopelessness I feel inside?
Can you take away this anger; can you throw away this rage?
Can you really show me love? Can you erase this hate?
Can you explain to me why my body is so frail?
How did I get here in an empty sail?
Why did he hurt me? The answers are unknown.
He took away my innocence. He invaded my soul.
I want to live. I don’t want to cry.
But I’ve lost the battle for inside I’ve died.
I may not be here by choice but it isn’t by chance;
that you’ve crossed my path and seen my circumstance.
I’ve tried everything else there’s nothing more I can do.
I’ve made the first step. The rest is up to you.
So here I am. Fix me if you can.
I give it to you; my life is in your hands.

                            21. In England once there lived a big
And wonderfully clever pig.
To everybody it was plain
That Piggy had a massive brain.
He worked out sums inside his head,
There was no book he hadn't read.
He knew what made an airplane fly,
He knew how engines worked and why.
He knew all this, but in the end
One question drove him round the bend:
He simply couldn't puzzle out
What LIFE was really all about.
What was the reason for his birth?
Why was he placed upon this earth?
His giant brain went round and round.
Alas, no answer could be found.
Till suddenly one wondrous night.
All in a flash he saw the light.
He jumped up like a ballet dancer
And yelled, 'By gum, I've got the answer! '
'They want my bacon slice by slice
'To sell at a tremendous price!
'They want my tender juicy chops
'To put in all the butcher's shops!
'They want my pork to make a roast
'And that's the part'll cost the most!
'They want my sausages in strings!
'They even want my chitterlings!
'The butcher's shop! The carving knife!
'That is the reason for my life! '
Such thoughts as these are not designed
To give a pig great peace of mind.
Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,
A pail of pigswill in his hand,
And piggy with a mighty roar,
Bashes the farmer to the floor…
Now comes the rather grisly bit
So let's not make too much of it,
Except that you must understand
That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,
He ate him up from head to toe,
Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
It took an hour to reach the feet,
Because there was so much to eat,
And when he finished, Pig, of course,
Felt absolutely no remorse.
Slowly he scratched his brainy head
And with a little smile he said,
'I had a fairly powerful hunch
'That he might have me for his lunch.
'And so, because I feared the worst,
'I thought I'd better eat him first.'

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</h2><br />

                            23. I Can Be A Star By Ma Rita N. Santiana "I can do this". This is my motto whenever things get bard because I believe that God is with me. "Come, let's practice, I called my friend Armand one late afternoon after our English class. He called other participants to proceed to the school gymnasium. Each one took his assigned place and started reciting the first stanza of the poem. Then, the second and so on until we successfully finished reciting the entire piece. "Good job, children! You can win this," Miss Villanueva, our English teacher commented How did Miss Villanueva motivate the children to give their best? I could still recall one of the most challenging moments in my life three years ago when I got sick of dengue. Nobody could tell that I can survive that time. But because I offered everything to God, I have nothing to worry. That moment made me realize that only in His hands can I be sure that I can be a star and will continue to shine even in the midst of darkness. If you are the narrator in the story, will you entrust everything to God? Why? Why not? Did you enjoy the story? Ponder on the most challenging moment in your life. How did you overcome it?

                            26. What's New Below is a simple poem about the life of a virtual gamer. Read the lines carefully and use your imagination as you move from one line to another. Answer briefly the questions that tells about how the gamer uses his body The Virtual Gamer by: Von RJ Josol I play the game from morning 'til night Never miss the chance to win the fight For I am destined to withstand the game I aim for victory and fame! I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever. Because you can never win your battle, if your body is gone. For a virtual gamer checks his facts more than ever.

                            27. (Analyze a Particular Point of View:)
Freedom
Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland!
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future;
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,
where movements are started through brainless wires,
repeated through mindless habits,
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
master of show,
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

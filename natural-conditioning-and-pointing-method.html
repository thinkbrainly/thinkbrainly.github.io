                                            PAKI EXPLAIN IN TAGALOG PO PLSS PARA PO SA REPORT KOThe operational technique in the waste managementsystem depends on the amount of waste that will betransported to landfills. The condition and limitations ofinfrastructure and limited land area as a place forprocessing and disposal of final waste become acommon problem in various regions in Indonesia. Thisoperational technique consists of :1. Storage is the initial stage in waste managementoperations. The storage is done to facilitate thecollection process. At this stage it can be donewaste sorting process. Waste sorting processcould be the determining point of theeffectiveness to next waste management system,while in many cities in Indonesia waste sortingprocess is carried out at temporary dump orfinal disposal [8] . Sorting organic waste can be
 Used as compost which is very good for plants
 whereas plastic waste can be reused or
 recycled  2. Collection, is a series of moving waste fromstorage to temporary dump. In general, the toolsused to collect are in the form of carts orgarbage rickshaws.3. Displacement, is the following step from thegarbage operational techniques where the wastein the temporary dump is then transferred to thetruck to be taken to the landfill or final disposal. 4. Transportation, is an important stage in wasteoperational techniques. The effectiveness andefficiency of transportation can be a benchmarkfor successful waste management. Delaying thewaste transportation causing increase the nextwaste loading and risk of disrupting theenvironmental comfort. Planning, evaluationand monitoring of facilities, routes andtransportation schedules are important.5.

                            6. PAKI EXPLAIN IN TAGALOG PO PLSS PARA PO SA REPORT KOThe operational technique in the waste managementsystem depends on the amount of waste that will betransported to landfills. The condition and limitations ofinfrastructure and limited land area as a place forprocessing and disposal of final waste become acommon problem in various regions in Indonesia. Thisoperational technique consists of :1. Storage is the initial stage in waste managementoperations. The storage is done to facilitate thecollection process. At this stage it can be donewaste sorting process. Waste sorting processcould be the determining point of theeffectiveness to next waste management system,while in many cities in Indonesia waste sortingprocess is carried out at temporary dump orfinal disposal [8] . Sorting organic waste can be
 Used as compost which is very good for plants
 whereas plastic waste can be reused or
 recycled  2. Collection, is a series of moving waste fromstorage to temporary dump. In general, the toolsused to collect are in the form of carts orgarbage rickshaws.3. Displacement, is the following step from thegarbage operational techniques where the wastein the temporary dump is then transferred to thetruck to be taken to the landfill or final disposal. 4. Transportation, is an important stage in wasteoperational techniques. The effectiveness andefficiency of transportation can be a benchmarkfor successful waste management. Delaying thewaste transportation causing increase the nextwaste loading and risk of disrupting theenvironmental comfort. Planning, evaluationand monitoring of facilities, routes andtransportation schedules are important.5. Final disposal / processing , is the end of wasteoperational techniques which is then the wastetreated with proper management and utilization.One of the waste management efforts that canbe done is by adding efective microorganisms(EM4) which affect the quality of compostmaturity which is better than the naturalcomposting process for in accordance withquality standards of mature compost [11].Principly, the final disposal is to destroy waste
as an effort to minimize environmentalproblems. In Indonesia, waste processingmethods include: open dumping , ContollLandfill, Sanitary Landfill, composting , and
burning.​</h2><br />

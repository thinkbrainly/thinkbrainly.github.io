                                            4. While the brain naturally slows down with age, the good news is that you 
can offset this process and minimize memory lapses by constantly
challenging your mind. In fact, memory-boosting classes are springing up
across the United States. "We now know that the brain is quite plastic, like a
muscle, that it can be changed and strengthened,” says Robert Goldman,
M.D., co-author of Brain Fitness. Following are ways to cross-train your 
brain...and save your memory.

                                            Exercise Your Brain Nearly seven out of every 10 adults report some type of forgetfulness, according to the Dana Foundation, a New York City organization with a special interest in brain research. More pronounced memory slips can begin as early as your 30s and become all too apparent in your 40s, explains Michael F. Rolzen, M.D., dean of the College of Medicine at the State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, and author of Real Age. While the brain naturally slows down with age, the good news is that you can offset this process and minimize memory lapses by constantly challenging your mind. In fact, memoryboosting classes are springing up across the United States. "We now know that the brain is quite plastic, like a muscle, that it can be changed and strengthened," says Robert Goldman, M.D., co author of Brain Fitness, Following are ways to cross-train your brain...and save your memory.</a>

The Haircut       When I woke up on Saturday, mom said I was a sheepdog with my long, shaggy hair, and it was time for me to get my hair cut. When I looked at her, she was a zebra, half hidden behind the drapes of my overgrown bangs. I couldn't help it. I laughed. She was right; my hair had to be cut. The barber's chair was a tower , and he pumped it higher and higher. I didn't really mind. I was an explorer, looking at the world in a whole new way. The pieces of hair on the floor were an exotic carpet of strange brown fibers that criss-crossed in a crazy pattern. The floor was an odd new planet, and I was an astronaut looking down from above. The barber pumped the chair again, and I was a rocket coming in for a landing. I couldn't believe the adventure was over so soon. On the way home, we stopped at the store to buy some milk. Unfortunately, there was some amazing sale going on at the time. We were tiny fish swimming in a sea of people. I could not wait to get out of there and go home. The drive home was a frustrating experience, because the holiday traffic had turned the street into a parking lot. I hope it's a long time before I'm a sheepdog again!pasagot naman po ASAP ​</a>

                            5. 4. While the brain naturally slows down with age, the good news is that you 
can offset this process and minimize memory lapses by constantly
challenging your mind. In fact, memory-boosting classes are springing up
across the United States. "We now know that the brain is quite plastic, like a
muscle, that it can be changed and strengthened,” says Robert Goldman,

                            18. Exercise Your Brain Nearly seven out of every 10 adults report some type of forgetfulness, according to the Dana Foundation, a New York City organization with a special interest in brain research. More pronounced memory slips can begin as early as your 30s and become all too apparent in your 40s, explains Michael F. Rolzen, M.D., dean of the College of Medicine at the State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, and author of Real Age. While the brain naturally slows down with age, the good news is that you can offset this process and minimize memory lapses by constantly challenging your mind. In fact, memoryboosting classes are springing up across the United States. "We now know that the brain is quite plastic, like a muscle, that it can be changed and strengthened," says Robert Goldman, M.D., co author of Brain Fitness, Following are ways to cross-train your brain...and save your memory.</h2><br />

Unfortunately, there was some amazing sale going on at the time. We were tiny fish swimming in a sea of people. I could not wait to get out of there and go home.

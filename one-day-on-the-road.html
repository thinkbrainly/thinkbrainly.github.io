THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
Robet Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, Long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
The where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Do you know how most elderly tell you to be careful with your choices? Well, that's because, at some point in life, you'd realize that each decision you make could heavily impact your future outcome. That <strong>every decision a person makes changes the course of someone's life. </strong>We shouldn't just take the pretty route because everyone takes it. For all we know, it wouldn't match us and would, eventually, change us into someone we no longer recognize. That's what each path represents. The dark, ugly road that is relatively untouched, symbolizes the harder decision in life that most people don't like taking. Be it studying hard to get A's as much as you can, or working hard on the littlest of tasks. However, the pretty and groomed path is the way most people like taking. It's easier and in a way more attractive than the previous path. These are the types of paths that people would not hesitate in taking. But good decisions that positively impact your life, even though it's hard to take, <strong>nearly always guarantee you a comfortable and rewarding future. </strong>If you had studied hard and got amazing grades, then chances are you'd be able to enter one of the top universities in your city/country, then you'd have a nice if not decent pay in a good company, then when you decide to retire, you won't have to worry about feeding your kids or providing them with a comfortable life since you have worked hard and earned enough.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Those in <strong>bold</strong> are answers to your question if you don't have time to read the whole thing. But I highly suggest you do so you'd understand the point I'm trying to make. And possibly it could help add more to your answer. I could only answer 1 and 3 because I didn't quite understand no.2 but if you could clarify what you need as an answer then I can definitely help.</p><br />

THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
Robet Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, Long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
The where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Just like life, the world can be just as unpredictable, especially when it comes to the choices you make. The world, as of right now, have many things going on; you never know what will happen next. You can speculate, but it is never 100% guaranteed. When you go down a road you have chosen, it can still very much change, it's unpredictable; things don't always go as planned. Whether we like it or not, we cannot travel both roads; yet, they're similar in the aspects of unpredictability. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
Questions:
1. Which road did the traveler take?
2. Why did he/she take that road? Read the lines that support your answer.
3. What qualities or characteristics does the traveler show? Explain your answer.
4. If you were the traveler, which of the two roads would you take? Why?
5. After reading the poem, how do you picture the two roads? Which do you think is safer and better road to take?</h2><br />
                        1. the traveler took the one less traveled by<br />2. Because it was grassy and wanted wear<br />3. The traveller shows bravery and curiosity as he took the road that is less travelled because he was curios why dont people go there.<br />4. Honestly, I would take the road that is much travelled by other people because I know that it is safe going there because a lot of people go there.<br />5. the less travelled road is the shortcut and the much travelled road is the correct way, the long way.<br /><br />pa brainliest tysm!! ^_^<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Structuralism is a literary theory that focuses on the underlying structures of a text and how those structures shape the meaning of the text. In analyzing "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost using structuralism, we can identify several key elements:</p><p></p><p>Binary oppositions: The poem sets up a series of binary oppositions, including two roads, two travelers, two claims, and two paths through life.</p><p>Metaphor: The two roads are a metaphor for the choices that we make in life, and the traveler's decision to take the "road less traveled" is a metaphor for taking a unique and unconventional path through life.</p><p>Form: The poem is structured into five stanzas of equal length, each with four lines. The first and third lines of each stanza rhyme, as do the second and fourth lines. This structure creates a sense of balance and symmetry in the poem.</p><p>Using these structural elements as a starting point, we can identify a real-life situation and an application of the value learned from the poem, as shown in the table below:</p><p>----------------------------</p><p></p><p>In the context of choosing a career path, "The Road Not Taken" can be seen as a metaphor for the importance of taking risks and following one's own unique path. The poem suggests that there is value in exploring the less-traveled roads of life, even if they are not always easy or well-worn. By taking a chance and pursuing an unconventional career path, for example, one might discover new opportunities and experiences that would not have been possible otherwise.</p><p></p><p>The value learned from the poem is the importance of making one's own choices in life, and the courage to take risks and explore new paths. By following one's own path, even if it is not the most popular or well-trodden, one can find fulfillment and meaning in life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

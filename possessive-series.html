Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</a>

Michael Faraday was born near London, one of the ten children in a poor working-class family. There was a little chance of anything but the most basic schooling before he was an apprenticed at the age of 14 to firm of bookseller. When he was about 19 years old, he was given a ticket to attend a series of lectures given by Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal Institution in London. This paved the way to his many discoveries and contributions to ciemisuy, magncüsm, cicuicity and ligini. he was convince üai magnetism could be made to generate electricity just as electricity could create magnetism. Faraday was also a fine lecturer and had an extraordinary gift for explaining the results of scientific research to non- scientist and young people. Eventually he succeeded Davy as superintendent of the Royal Institution. He described his education as follows; "My education was of the most ordinary description consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic at the common day school. My hours out of school were passed at home and in the streets." Do you possess these characteristics? If you do, then you can be a physicist too.​</a>

                            18. Case on Education and Training    The President/COO of a small manufacturing firm of about 300 employees had learned over the years the value of education and training. Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a whole…., It's not easy to introduce TQM. An open, cooperative culture has to be created by management. Employees have to be made to feel that they are responsible for customer satisfaction. They are not going to feel this if they are excluded from the development of visions, strategies, and plans. It's important they participate in these activities. They are unlikely to behave in a responsible way if they see management behaving irresponsibly - saying one thing and doing the opposite.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT'S HELP PA BRAINLIEST TY</p><p>SOURCE; G0OGLE</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. ASSIMILATION: Learning Task 4: Make a reaction paper about the life of Michael Faraday. Michael Faraday was born near London, one of the ten children in a poor working-class family. There was a little chance of anything but the most basic schooling before he was an apprenticed at the age of 14 to firm of bookseller. When he was about 19 years old, he was given a ticket to attend a series of lectures given by Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal Institution in London. This paved the way to his many discoveries and contributions to ciemisuy, magncüsm, cicuicity and ligini. he was convince üai magnetism could be made to generate electricity just as electricity could create magnetism. Faraday was also a fine lecturer and had an extraordinary gift for explaining the results of scientific research to non- scientist and young people. Eventually he succeeded Davy as superintendent of the Royal Institution. He described his education as follows; "My education was of the most ordinary description consisting of little more than the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic at the common day school. My hours out of school were passed at home and in the streets." Do you possess these characteristics? If you do, then you can be a physicist too.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my opinion, Mr. Michael Faraday is amazing and cool. He is smart and can explain the results of scientific research to non-scientist and young people. He is amazing to me because not all physicist/scientist can/could explain the results of scientific research to non-scientist's and young peoples, because most of the non-scientist and young people can't understand the results of scientific research.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> sorry in advance if the answer is incorrect..</p><p></p><br />

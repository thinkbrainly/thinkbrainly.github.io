In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire. It was developed by the researchers although some of the questionnaires were based from other studies and resources available in the books.​</a>

                                            Learning Activity SheetP a g e | 3 Grade9a.Check for Consciousness1.Ask the victim: “Hey, hey, are you okay?” while carefully shaking the victim’s shoulder.2.When there is no response, not even mumbles or groans, the victim is unconscious and in need of immediate medical help.b.Open the Airway1.The victim’s unconsciousness maybe due to an obstruction in his/her airway. It may also be caused by a narrowed airway making breathing impossible.2.Find out if there is loss of muscular control in the throat area which allows the tongue to slip back and block the throat.3.Lift the chin and tilt the head of the victim (if the victim is an adult). This way you will be able to lift the tongue from the back of the throat, leaving the airway clear.c.Check for Breathing1.Put your face near the victim’s mouth and look, listen, and feel for breathing. You should observe for:Chest movement, sound of breathing, or feel of breath on your cheekd.Check for Circulation1.Locate pulse using your middle and index finger. Pulse indicates blood circulation, which is essential for the heart and brain to function.2.Poor blood circulation may be reflected on the pale color of the skin. This is fatal.3.To revive circulation, perform CPR immediately.2.Secondary SurveySecondary survey is used when the victim is conscious or has revived.It aims to detect everything about the patient’s condition.a.History TakingSAMPLE PAIN is the mnemonic in order to perform the steps more easily.S-ymptoms (the chief complaint of the patient)A-llergy (find out if the victim is allergic to anything)M-edication (what are the medicines s/he is currently taking) P- revious illness (that may be related to the problem)L-ast meal (only for those subject for operation)E-vents prior to what happenedP-eriod of pain (How long? What started it?)A-rea (Where is the pain coming from?)I-ntensityN-ullify (What stopped it?)b.Checking for Vital Signs A. Pulse rateSteps in checking the pulse:Use your fingertips in getting the pulse. Follow the following procedure:1.Place the finger tip over an artery where it either crosses a bone or lies close to the skin.2.Feel the pulsations as the pressure wave of blood causes the vessel wall to expand –that is the pulse.The pulse rate may be taken in different points in the body like:1.Brachial5. Subclavian2.Carotid6. Axillary3.Wrist 7. Femoral4.TemporalNO-NO in Getting Pulse RateNever use your thumb; it has its own pulse.Do not palpate both the c​</a>

In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire. It was developed by the researchers although some of the questionnaires were based from other studies and resources available in the books.​</h2><br />

                            23. DIRECTION: Summarize the following paragraphs into simple sentences. A sample is given for your reference. Write your summaries on your answer sheet. Sentence Example: It is undeniable that the large majority of non-native learners of English experience a number of problems in attempting to master the phonetic patterns of the language. 1. Speech has another, and subtler, attentional advantage. Manual gesture is much more demanding of attention, since you must keep your eyes fixed on gesturer in order to extract her meaning, whereas speech can be understood regardless of where you are looking. Summary Many learners find English pronunciation difficult. 2. Women workers in the country have a college diploma rate of 21.5%, higher than the 10% of the male workers. Despite the high college accomplishment rate of our women workers, 5.84 million are in work categorized as laborers, unskilled, or agricultural. 3. With indefinite restrictions in movement imposed across the world until a vaccine or cure is found for Covid-19, it is expected that a great number of people continue to feel isolated, anxious or even depressed within this so called new normal.​</h2><br />

                            24. Learning Activity SheetP a g e | 3 Grade9a.Check for Consciousness1.Ask the victim: “Hey, hey, are you okay?” while carefully shaking the victim’s shoulder.2.When there is no response, not even mumbles or groans, the victim is unconscious and in need of immediate medical help.b.Open the Airway1.The victim’s unconsciousness maybe due to an obstruction in his/her airway. It may also be caused by a narrowed airway making breathing impossible.2.Find out if there is loss of muscular control in the throat area which allows the tongue to slip back and block the throat.3.Lift the chin and tilt the head of the victim (if the victim is an adult). This way you will be able to lift the tongue from the back of the throat, leaving the airway clear.c.Check for Breathing1.Put your face near the victim’s mouth and look, listen, and feel for breathing. You should observe for:Chest movement, sound of breathing, or feel of breath on your cheekd.Check for Circulation1.Locate pulse using your middle and index finger. Pulse indicates blood circulation, which is essential for the heart and brain to function.2.Poor blood circulation may be reflected on the pale color of the skin. This is fatal.3.To revive circulation, perform CPR immediately.2.Secondary SurveySecondary survey is used when the victim is conscious or has revived.It aims to detect everything about the patient’s condition.a.History TakingSAMPLE PAIN is the mnemonic in order to perform the steps more easily.S-ymptoms (the chief complaint of the patient)A-llergy (find out if the victim is allergic to anything)M-edication (what are the medicines s/he is currently taking) P- revious illness (that may be related to the problem)L-ast meal (only for those subject for operation)E-vents prior to what happenedP-eriod of pain (How long? What started it?)A-rea (Where is the pain coming from?)I-ntensityN-ullify (What stopped it?)b.Checking for Vital Signs A. Pulse rateSteps in checking the pulse:Use your fingertips in getting the pulse. Follow the following procedure:1.Place the finger tip over an artery where it either crosses a bone or lies close to the skin.2.Feel the pulsations as the pressure wave of blood causes the vessel wall to expand –that is the pulse.The pulse rate may be taken in different points in the body like:1.Brachial5. Subclavian2.Carotid6. Axillary3.Wrist 7. Femoral4.TemporalNO-NO in Getting Pulse RateNever use your thumb; it has its own pulse.Do not palpate both the c​</h2><br />

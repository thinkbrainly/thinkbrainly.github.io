                                            Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. Ayan po yung story pls po need ko na po brainliest ko agar sagot pag matino​</a>

In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.

Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland.

But its form is always changing, from solid to liquid, from liquid to gas, and back again. It moves in a pattern called the water cycle. Heat from the sun causes water in oceans, lakes and rivers to evaporate into vapor. Further vapor is given off by plants and animals. *A – Enumeration Text TypeB – Time Order Text TypeC – Classification Text TypeD – Explanation Text Type5. The atmosphere is composed of different levels. The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48km above the Earth’s surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied, and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55km. the temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from above the Earth. The air id ionized by the Sun’s ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, there are six levels of the Earth atmosphere. *A – Enumeration Text TypeB – Time Order Text TypeC – Classification Text TypeD – Explanation Text Typenonsense = reportcorrect answer = brainliesthalf correct = like</a>

He rejected the ancient idea that plants take most of their 3.__________ from the soil. For the proof, he performed 4._________________. He started with a willow tree of 2.27 kg. Over 5 years, it grew to 67.7 kg. However, the weight of the soil only decreased by 57 grams. Van Helmont came to the conclusion that plants must take most of their weight from water. He did not know about gases. 5.__________ ran a series of experiments in 6.__________ He tested a 7._______, a candle, and a sprig of mint under hermetically sealed (no air can go in or out) jar. He first observed that a mouse and a candle behave very similarly when covered, in that they both “spend” the air. However, when a plant is placed with either the candle or mouse, the plant “8_________” the air for both. Further ideas were brought about in the late 1700’s. 9.______________ and 10.______________ found that the air is only reviving in the day time and that CO2 is assembled by plants. 11.___________________ found that “revived air” is a separate gas, oxygen. But what is the oxygen “maker”? There are many pigments in plants, and all accept and reflect some parts of rainbow. To identify the culprit, 12.__________________ ran an experiment using a 13._______________. He found that 14.______________ produce oxygen mostly in the blue and red parts of the spectrum. This was a huge find. It tells that the key photosynthetic pigment should accept blue and red rays, and thus reflect green rays. 15.__________________ best fits this description. ​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Planting trees is a learning environment because it provides healthy and beautiful places for children to play and learn. We can make it as a school project. By using tree planting, we can instill a sense of environmental awareness amongst youths or in school ages</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We arrived ( I about thirty minutes late because i got lost trying to walk) early in the morning, grabbed a couple shovels and started digging.</p><p>Each student was to plant 4 small karamunting trees as a way to improve the environment by lessening carbon emissions we put out everyday via transport, improper disposal, and using technology. This experience taught students how to plant trees properly and how to make the difference.</p><p></p><p>What aspect caused you the most anxiety?</p><p>When I heard we would be planting four trees each I was anxious and a little disappointed but enjoyed getting dirty and taking some stress out with the very small shovel. I have planted things like flowers and small plants but not trees and i suppose I was intimidated by the the steep slope and tools. Seeing the tree successfully in the ground and knowing that it will grow tall like the others surrounding it is the ultimate highlight of my experience.</p><p></p><p>Was there any aspect of the experience that suprised you?</p><p>I was suprised to learn that the karamunting tree has become an endangered species and was relieved that the forestry department and the BEACA plecturers ares taking the initiative to rebuild the species quantity. Physically I was suprised at how quickly I was able to plant the trees. Planting a single tree involves hard work but once you get the hang of planting one tree, the rest aren't nearly as difficult.</p><p></p><p>What were the three most important things you learnt from the experience?</p><p>1. the proper way to plant a tree - including measurements and furtalizers.</p><p>2. That the karamunting tree is a part of the endangered species list and our efforts to help take this species off the list is a step toward a more stable environment.</p><p>3. 2 is only possible if the maintenance of the tree is taken care of.</p><p></p><p>Which aspects would you include in your future behavior based on your learnings from this experience?</p><p></p><p>Planting the trees felt good and I enjoy helping make our environment a better habitat for all. Therefore, if there are tree planting activities I am much more likely to participate. Next time though I would like to plant more than four trees. I now look at a tree differently- I find myself taking the time to think of the growth stages and have become to appreciate a tall healthy tree. It is unfrotunate that it takes so long for a tree to grow and then it's just cut down for quick scratch paper but thats the world we live in. It's fortunate however, that there are people who go out of their way to help the environment like the BEACA professors and lecturers in collaborating to raise awareness of environmental matters and show students how to make a difference.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.</p><br />

                            7. Taro, The Great SpiderBy Menere R. NasiadIn a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens. After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people. The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see theenormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro,The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village. The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea. “I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him.“How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked.“I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom.

                            8. Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Reflection is when light bounces off an object. If the surface is smooth and shiny, like glass, water or polished metal, the light will reflect at the same angle as it hit the surface. This is called specular reflection. letter "A"</p><p>2.Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. letter "A"</p><p>3.Materials that allow most all light to pass through them are called transparent. Examples of transparent items are glass, water, and air. Those materials that allow some light to pass through them are called translucent and include things like frosted glass and wax paper. letter"A"</p><p>4.A black object absorbs all wavelengths of light and converts them into heat, so the object gets warm. A white object reflects all wavelengths of light, so the light is not converted into heat and the temperature of the object does not increase noticeably. letter"C"</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help </p><p>wait po ung iba cocomment ko later(✷‿✷)</p><p></p><br />

                            17. 3. Forests are very useful. They supply lumber which is used for building houses, stones, offices and other buildings. Some forest trees give materials for making pulp, paper, wallboard and furniture, rattan, gum and firewood. Medicinal plants are also taken from forests. *A – Enumeration Text TypeB – Time Order Text TypeC – Classification Text TypeD – Explanation Text Type4. The amount of water on Earth remains constant. But its form is always changing, from solid to liquid, from liquid to gas, and back again. It moves in a pattern called the water cycle. Heat from the sun causes water in oceans, lakes and rivers to evaporate into vapor. Further vapor is given off by plants and animals. *A – Enumeration Text TypeB – Time Order Text TypeC – Classification Text TypeD – Explanation Text Type5. The atmosphere is composed of different levels. The first level, called troposphere, is the nearest to Earth, about 11km thick. Most clouds and weather are found in this layer. Next is the stratosphere which is about 11-48km above the Earth’s surface. In it is the ozone layer which absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The mesosphere is above the stratosphere in which the atmosphere is very rarefied, and the temperature decreases with altitude. The fourth layer is the thermosphere which starts at about 55km. the temperature is so hot that it cannot be measured by a thermometer. Temperature may be thousands of degrees high. The second to the last is the exosphere, the region beyond the thermosphere. Finally, the ionosphere overlaps the other layers from above the Earth. The air id ionized by the Sun’s ultraviolet rays. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. All in all, there are six levels of the Earth atmosphere. *A – Enumeration Text TypeB – Time Order Text TypeC – Classification Text TypeD – Explanation Text Typenonsense = reportcorrect answer = brainliesthalf correct = like</h2><br />

                            20. DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces. Among its recent projects was the rehabilitation of the Polo Mini-Park which was inaugurated on January 21, 2020. The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag. Various activities are being offered one of the newest attractions in the city such as recreational fishing, line fishing tutorials, bird watching, boating, photo-walk, and sunset watching. Based on the passage, the following are reflective of the locals' (resident of Tagalag) culture and values, except one: ChooseResidents major livelihood is fishing relatedIt has its share of hassle and bustle of the city properTagalag is a sanctuary or haven for endangered and migratory birdsIt has an air of welcoming atmosphere for local and foreign tourists alike.5. Besides that pensive view of northwest, the opposite phase is home to big manufacturing companies, such as CDO, Uratex, San Miguel Corporation, Plastic City, Splash, among others. From there, it can be inferred that Valenzuela is a highly _____ City ChooseCommercialAgriculturalIndustrialFInancial</h2><br />

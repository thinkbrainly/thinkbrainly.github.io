                                            The Main Contexts of a Literary Work Friday, 9 October, 1942 Dear Kitty, I’ve only got dismal and depressing news for you today. Our many Jewish friends are being taken away by the dozen. These people are treated by the Gestapo without a shred of decency, being loaded into cattle trucks and sent to Westerbork, the big Jewish camp in Drente. Westerbork sounds terrible: only one washing cubicle for a hundred people and not enough lavatories. There is no separate accommodation. Men, women and children all sleep together. One hears of frightful immorality because of this; and a lot of the women, and even girls, who stay there for a length of time are expecting babies. It is impossible to escape; most of the people in the camp are branded as inmates by their shaven heads and many also by their Jewish appearance. If it is as bad as this in Holland whatever will it be like in the distant and barabarous regions they are sent to? We assume that most of them are murdered. The English radio speaks of their being gassed. Perhaps that is the quickest way to die. I feel terribly upset. I couldn’t hear myself away while Miep told these dreadful stories; and she herself was equally wound up for that matter. Just recently for instance, a poor old crippled Jewess was sitting on her doorstep; she had been told to wait there by the Gestapo, who had gone to fetch a car to take her away. The poor old thing was terrified by the guns that were shooting ate English planes overheard and by glaring beams of the searchlights. But Miep did not take her in; no one would undergo such a risk. The Germans strike without slightest mercy. Elli too is very quiet: her boyfriend has got to go to Germany. She is afraid that airmen who fly over our homes will drop their bombs, often weighing a million kilos, on Dirk’s head. Jokes such as "he’s not likely to get a million" and "it only takes a bomb" are in bad taste. Dirk is certainly not the only one who has to go: trainloads of boys leave daily. If they stop at a small station en route, sometimes some of them manage to get out unnoticed and escape; perhaps a few manage it. This, however, is not the end of my bad news. Have you ever heard of hostages? That’s the latest thing in penalties for sabotage. Can you imagine anything so dreadful? Prominent citizens—innocent people--- are thrown into prisons to await their fate. If the saboteur can’t be traced, the Gestapo simply put about five hostages against the wall. Announcements of their deaths appear in the paper frequently. These outrages are described as "fatal accidents". Nice people, the Germans! To think that I was once one of them too! No, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. Germans and Jews are the greatest enemies in the world Using the guide questions in writing a BIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS stated in your module, write a 7-10 sentence analysis of the text.</a>

                                            PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term "hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Leading citizens -- innocent people -- are taken prisoner to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal accidents.'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. And besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.Instruction: Answer the following questions about Anne Frank’s diary entry above.1.Make a list of all the adjectives and adverbs that you find in the diary entry.

                            4. The Main Contexts of a Literary Work Friday, 9 October, 1942 Dear Kitty, I’ve only got dismal and depressing news for you today. Our many Jewish friends are being taken away by the dozen. These people are treated by the Gestapo without a shred of decency, being loaded into cattle trucks and sent to Westerbork, the big Jewish camp in Drente. Westerbork sounds terrible: only one washing cubicle for a hundred people and not enough lavatories. There is no separate accommodation. Men, women and children all sleep together. One hears of frightful immorality because of this; and a lot of the women, and even girls, who stay there for a length of time are expecting babies. It is impossible to escape; most of the people in the camp are branded as inmates by their shaven heads and many also by their Jewish appearance. If it is as bad as this in Holland whatever will it be like in the distant and barabarous regions they are sent to? We assume that most of them are murdered. The English radio speaks of their being gassed. Perhaps that is the quickest way to die. I feel terribly upset. I couldn’t hear myself away while Miep told these dreadful stories; and she herself was equally wound up for that matter. Just recently for instance, a poor old crippled Jewess was sitting on her doorstep; she had been told to wait there by the Gestapo, who had gone to fetch a car to take her away. The poor old thing was terrified by the guns that were shooting ate English planes overheard and by glaring beams of the searchlights. But Miep did not take her in; no one would undergo such a risk. The Germans strike without slightest mercy. Elli too is very quiet: her boyfriend has got to go to Germany. She is afraid that airmen who fly over our homes will drop their bombs, often weighing a million kilos, on Dirk’s head. Jokes such as "he’s not likely to get a million" and "it only takes a bomb" are in bad taste. Dirk is certainly not the only one who has to go: trainloads of boys leave daily. If they stop at a small station en route, sometimes some of them manage to get out unnoticed and escape; perhaps a few manage it. This, however, is not the end of my bad news. Have you ever heard of hostages? That’s the latest thing in penalties for sabotage. Can you imagine anything so dreadful? Prominent citizens—innocent people--- are thrown into prisons to await their fate. If the saboteur can’t be traced, the Gestapo simply put about five hostages against the wall. Announcements of their deaths appear in the paper frequently. These outrages are described as "fatal accidents". Nice people, the Germans! To think that I was once one of them too! No, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. Germans and Jews are the greatest enemies in the world Using the guide questions in writing a BIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS stated in your module, write a 7-10 sentence analysis of the text.</h2><br />

                            5. PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations.

                                            DEVLOPING A STRATEEGIC PROSPECTING PLAN BACKGROUND: Jennifer Hamman graduated from the state university and was hired as a sales representative for the Logistics Company. The Logistics Company is a transportation broker that links companies needing products shipped with trucking firms to carry the shipments. After an initial training program, Jennifer was given a couple of existing company customers and a small list of leads to get her started. She began by serving the shipment needs of the existing customers. This gave her some confidence, but she realized that for her to be successful, she must begin prospecting and try to identify the best sales opportunities. The Logistics Company provides an ongoing list of leads that can be accessed by all salespeople. Once a salesperson contacts one of these lead, no other salesperson can contact then. Jennifer started her prospecting by contacting these leads. CURRENT SITUATION: Jennifer has been calling a number of leads each day, but has not been very successful in generating much business. She feels like she is wasting much of her time on leads that are not good sales opportunities. The leads provided by her company are not qualified in any way and the training program she attended focused on cold calling as the basic prospecting method. Jennifer took a professional selling class in college and remembered that the chapter on prospecting emphasized the need to follow the strategic prospecting process to identify the best sales opportunities. She found her professional selling textbook, went to the chapter on prospecting, and decided to create a strategic prospecting plan. QUESTIONS: What methods should Jennifer use to generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company? How should Jennifer qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself? What is the profile of an ideal prospects? How should Jennifer prioritize her qualified prospects? What information should Jennifer collect to prepare for sales dialogue with a prospect? Jennifer used Linkedin during college and wanted to employ it in her strategic prospecting process. How can she best use Linkedin?​</a>

the assembly section are generally, undersize of outer diameter, oversize of inner diameter, and 
unproportioned collar or width. In the like manner, the defects in the casting section generally involves 
cracks, hardness, porosity, or evident holes in the produced cylinders. Hence, it is necessary for the 
company to reduce the cost of rework due to defects in assembly and casting section to improve the 
quality of their products.
The company also targets to increase their sales in the market to gain a significant market share. Solid 
Industries know that they can only move forward to their goals if they will be able to find a way to achieve 
good quality products and operational efficiency through maximized productivity and reduced internal 
costs. Under these circumstances, the company established three (3) major objectives: to improve the 
overall efficiency of the system in assembly and casting section; to maximize output per section with less 
defects; and to modify the production process for better understanding and execution.

This can be done through techniques such as value stream mapping or process flow analysis. Once areas of improvement are identified, Solid Industries can implement process changes or introduce new technologies to streamline their operations. Additionally, implementing a continuous improvement culture, where employees are encouraged to identify and address issues as they arise, can help facilitate ongoing process modification.</p><p></p><p>III. Alternative Courses of Action</p><p>a. Six Sigma process improvement methodology</p><p>Advantages: Six Sigma is a proven methodology that has been successful in improving efficiency and reducing defects in manufacturing processes. It also provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing root causes of issues.</p><p>Disadvantages: Implementing Six Sigma can be time-consuming and may require significant resources, including training for employees and the acquisition of specialized software. It may also be difficult to sustain long-term without ongoing commitment and resources.</p><p></p><p>b. Lean manufacturing principles</p><p>Advantages: Lean manufacturing focuses on identifying and eliminating waste in the production process, which can lead to increased efficiency and lower costs. It also emphasizes continuous improvement and can be easily integrated into an existing production process.</p><p>Disadvantages: Implementing lean principles may require significant changes to the current production process, which can be disruptive and may require additional training for employees. It may also be difficult to sustain long-term without ongoing commitment and resources.</p><p></p><p>IV. Recommendation</p><p>Based on the information provided, it is recommended that Solid Industries consider implementing a combination of Six Sigma and lean manufacturing principles in order to improve efficiency, reduce defects, and modify their production process. Six Sigma can provide a structured approach for identifying and addressing root causes of issues, while lean manufacturing can help streamline operations by eliminating waste and increasing efficiency. Additionally, implementing a continuous improvement culture can help ensure that these improvements are sustained over the long term. However, it is important for Solid Industries to carefully consider the resources and commitment required for implementing these changes, and to ensure that they have the necessary support and buy-in from all stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I. Background</strong></p><p>Solid Industries is a manufacturer of cylinder liners that experiences defects in the assembly and casting sections of their production process. These defects result in rework and cost the company time and resources. The company has established three major objectives: to improve the overall efficiency of their system in the assembly and casting sections, to maximize output with fewer defects, and to modify the production process for better understanding and execution.</p><p></p><p><strong>II. Statement of the Problem</strong></p><p>a. How can Solid Industries improve the overall efficiency of their system in the assembly and casting sections?</p><p>One potential course of action for improving efficiency in the assembly and casting sections could be to implement a continuous improvement program, such as Six Sigma or Lean Manufacturing.

                            29. DEVLOPING A STRATEEGIC PROSPECTING PLAN BACKGROUND: Jennifer Hamman graduated from the state university and was hired as a sales representative for the Logistics Company. The Logistics Company is a transportation broker that links companies needing products shipped with trucking firms to carry the shipments. After an initial training program, Jennifer was given a couple of existing company customers and a small list of leads to get her started. She began by serving the shipment needs of the existing customers. This gave her some confidence, but she realized that for her to be successful, she must begin prospecting and try to identify the best sales opportunities. The Logistics Company provides an ongoing list of leads that can be accessed by all salespeople. Once a salesperson contacts one of these lead, no other salesperson can contact then. Jennifer started her prospecting by contacting these leads. CURRENT SITUATION: Jennifer has been calling a number of leads each day, but has not been very successful in generating much business. She feels like she is wasting much of her time on leads that are not good sales opportunities. The leads provided by her company are not qualified in any way and the training program she attended focused on cold calling as the basic prospecting method. Jennifer took a professional selling class in college and remembered that the chapter on prospecting emphasized the need to follow the strategic prospecting process to identify the best sales opportunities. She found her professional selling textbook, went to the chapter on prospecting, and decided to create a strategic prospecting plan. QUESTIONS: What methods should Jennifer use to generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company? How should Jennifer qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself? What is the profile of an ideal prospects? How should Jennifer prioritize her qualified prospects? What information should Jennifer collect to prepare for sales dialogue with a prospect? Jennifer used Linkedin during college and wanted to employ it in her strategic prospecting process. How can she best use Linkedin?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>To generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company, Jennifer could use a variety of methods, such as networking, attending industry events, and conducting research to identify potential customers. She could also consider leveraging social media, such as LinkedIn, to connect with potential customers and identify potential sales opportunities.</p><p></p><p>To qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself, Jennifer should consider factors such as the potential customer's industry, size, location, and shipping needs. She should also consider whether the potential customer has a need for the services offered by the Logistics Company, and whether the potential customer has the ability to pay for those services.</p><p></p><p>The profile of an ideal prospect for Jennifer would likely include companies in industries that require frequent shipping, such as manufacturing or retail, and are located in close proximity to the Logistics Company's network of trucking partners.

                                            Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.

Renewable energy is energy that comes from sources that may naturally be replenished over time.Examples of renewable energy are biomass in general, hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal. Whilethe use of renewable energy is friendlier to the environment, its yield is much less when compared withtraditional sources.2. Everyone should practice CLAYGO or Clean as you go not only in schools but in all places as well. Weshould be responsible for our own waste. If we always rely on somebody else to clean after us, what willhappen if nobody is there to do it anymore? Ensuring the cleanliness of our surroundings should not be theresponsibility of only a few people but of everyone.3. Every morning, George wakes up to the sound of his alarm. It's four o'clock in the morning, He just hadthree hours of sleep coming from a two-hour battle with traffic going home the previous night. Now, hehas to get up again, take a bath, and prepared himself for another two hours of tiresome commute backto work.4. Last week, our class planted some bean seeds in ice-cream cups. We watered the seeds. After that weplaced the cups on the window sill in the sun. About five days later, we observed that some of the seedswere beginning to germinate. A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of theweek, they were about seven centimeters tall.5. Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers, lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into theair. That water vapors form clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on howhigh the clouds is and how cold it is.) As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. Whenthe water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.​</a>

                                            “Here we go again, “complain Ben. “ Everytime we try to use a budget we end up arguing and still don’t have enough money”. Yolanda replied, “Maybe if we kept track of everything we spend,we would have some idea of where our money goes,” “No not that!” Ben exclaimed. “I have a friend who keeps a notebook and lists everything he spends. That would drive me crazy.” “well, we can’t keep going like we have,” responded Yolanda. “ A year ago decided to sort all their check stubs,receipts, and credit card statements to see where their money was going. Last year, they spent over $2,000 in restaurants and cared over $800 in their vacation. I didn’t realize we spent that much on those things” commented Ben. We also had auto maintenance costs of$1,650 and donated $ 1,800 to the homeless shelter and church. Those are things we had to do and wanted to do.” Yolanda replied, “but no that we know how spend our money, what do we do next?” “May we should get a computerized money management program”, Ben suggested Yolanda countered, “Maybe we should just start with spending a few dollars on a notebook and file folders to record and sort our receipts”. QUESTIONS: 1. What would Ben and Yolanda learn by sorting their expenses into various categories? What categories should they use? 2. How can knowing where their money goes help Ben and Yolanda plan their spending? 3. What financial goals might Ben and Yolanda consider to address some of their money management concerns?4.

Directions: Read the following Steps in "WRAP A BOX" carefully. Complete each step by writing the appropriate word
on the blanks provided.
A. Lay the box topside down over your 1.
paper. Place the box in the middle of the paper, with the
top facing down. Place it about 2
between the edge of the wrapping paper and the roll of wrapping
paper
B. Wrap the paper over the box. Take the 3
of the wrapping paper and wrap it around the box so it
covers about half the box. Then, roll the tube of the wrapping paper over the box all the way to the other
of the box. The box should no be completely covered in wrapping paper.
C. Cut the paper so the wrapping paper overlaps. The wrapping paper should overlap just slightly on top of the box
Cut a 5
line across the upper layer of wrapping paper so it overlaps the bottom layer by a few inches
or centimeters,
D. 6
one side of the paper to the box. Once you've cut the paper to the right size, you can let go
of it. Put the roll of paper aside and grab 7
tape. Fold one end of the paper over the box and press
it fiat against the bottom of the box Place a plece of scotch tape near the middle of the box to secure the paper.
E. Fold over the other side of the paper and tape it down. Fold the other side of the paper over the top of box. Overlap
this paper slightly with the paper you just taped down. Place a piece of tape on the 8,
of the box,
securing the top layer of paper to the bottom layer.
F. Tuck in the paper on the 9.
of the box. Two sides of the box will still have unfolded paper sticking
out. Starting on one side, push both ends of the paper Inward so they 10.
the corners of the box.
G. Crease the triangle shaped folds. Once the ends are hugging the corners of the box, you will notice
11.
triangle shape folds on each of the box's corners. Use your fingers to crease each fold to secure
it.
H. Fold the upper and lower 12.
together. At this point, on the top and bottom of the box, there
should be two trapezoid-shaped flaps. Push the top flap down and crease the edge to secure it. Then, push the bottom
flap upward so it overlaps with the top flap. Again, crease the edge to secure the fold.

                                            Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</a>

                                            I have been anticipating my senior year since the day I walked into my Kindergarten classroom. I always adored the older kids that only had one year of torture left. However; now that I am a senior, I absolutely cannot wait for the amazing opportunities that will come with this year. As my highschool career comes to an end, I have set some goals to ensure that I will have the best year possible. Although I have moved to a new place, and have been forced to start everything completely over again, I plan to make the most of this year. I want this year to be the best that I have ever had. One of the biggest goals that I have set for my senior year, is to pursue my dream to success. Graduating is a huge part of senior year, and I have been ready to graduate since birth, discover my passions and choose a path to college that will lead me to a successful career that I enjoy.I grew up a lot and matured to a level that allowed me to see my real potentialchanging my past for it is has led me to who I am now. However as I grow and reflect on circumstances that have occurred, I realize that there are instances in which I yearn that I would have done things differently.​</a>

(10 points)___________ 1. My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool.  We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.  He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!”___________ 2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse.___________ 3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.___________ 4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating.___________ 5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.​</a>

When he says that his Ox Meadows touch her birch woods, she begins to argue withhim about the ownership of that piece of land. After her father notices they are arguing, he joins in and thensends Lomov out of the house. Choobookov then tells his daughter that Lomov was there to propose to her.Natalia repents and asks her father to call him back. Lomov comes, and she asks him about his huntingprogram. He says that he will start hunting after harvest because his best dog has gone lame. At this point,Natalia contradicts him again and claims that her dog Leap is better than his dog Guess. Thus, the quarrelbegins again till over-excitement makes Lomov faint in a chair. Seeing him quiet and unmoving, Nataliathinks that he is dead and becomes hysterical. Lomov comes to his senses, and Choobookov forces them tokiss each other and accept the marriage proposal. Immediately following the kiss, Natalia and Lomov startquarreling. Choobookov shouts for Champagne because he wants to celebrate their marriage, and at thesame time, he feels free from the burden of his grown-up daughter.Source: "A Marriage Proposal" - Summary | Major English Class 12, merospark.comDirections: Using the summary plot "A Marriage Proposal" by Anton Chekhov, fill in the story map belowwith the necessary information.

The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

Condensation - is the changing of water vapor into water droplets forming clouas. Precipitation - is the process of which water droplets fall down to Earth.The sun, being the main source of heat on earth plays the major role inthe water cycle. When the Earth's surface is heated by the sun, evaporationtakes place in the bodies of water and on land.Water particles are also released to the atmosphere from the leaves ofplants through the process of transpiration, Animals and humans give off waterparticies when they perspire during perspiration and during respiration whichevaporato in the atmosphere.When the water vapor in the atmosphere had cooled, condensationprocess will take place. The condensed water vapor in the cloud is transportedand move from one location to another in the atmosphere. When the condensedwater vapor become heavy. it falls back to the Earth in the form of rain, hail,snow, and sleet, this is called precipitationWhen water falls back to the Earth, it ends up on land, it will become partof ground water that animals and humans including plants can use, or it may runover the soil and collect it in the oceans, lakes, rivers where the cycle starts allOver again.The rate of evaporation and condensation is affected by the light and heatof the sun. Evaporation is fast when the temperature is high while condensation isfast when temperature is low.Guide Questions:1. What are the main processes involved in the Water Cycle2.

We get fresh water through the water cycle Paragraph No After all these processes, the cycle starts again Paragraph No So, over and over again, the water moves from the oceans and the rivers to the clouds. Then it falls into the land as rain and moves back to ocean and rivers Paragraph No. The water cycle has four parts. The first part is evaporation. Evaporation is when the sun heats up the water from the ocean and rivers and turns into water vapor or steam, this means it changes from liquid into gas. This gas goes into the air Paragraph No. Then, when so much water has condensed the clouds become very heavy, and the air cannot hold it anymore, thus precipitation happens. The water fals back to the earth in the form of rain or snow Paragraph No. The final part of the cycle is collection. Water from precipitation when it ends up on the land, it will either soak into the earth and become part of the ground water that plants and animals use to drink or it may run over the soil and collect in the oceans, rivers and lakes. Paragraph No. The next part of the water cycle is condensation. When water vapor gets cold, Mums into small drops of water. These becomes clouds​</a>

Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

Princess Polite (Short Story)
by Jasmine Logan, Grade pr, QLD
Once there was a girl called Princess Polite but people in her castle
called her Polly or Polly Polite. One day a super star came to her castle. Polly
said, “Why have you come here? And what is your name?” The super star
said “My name is Sarah Jones. I’m here to rock out on your castle’s stage!”
Polly said, “I don’t have a stage in my castle!”
“Oh dear!” Sarah cried. Polly said, “I will make a grand stage just for
you and I will name it Stage Sarah.” Sarah said.
“You don’t have to call it stage Sarah.” Polly called for the best
builders in the land to come build the stage. The building started. It took
them two years to build it! Polly called Sarah on the phone.
“It’s finished come see!” Polly said.
“Sure, I’ll be there as soon as possible!” Superstar Sarah said. Sarah
brought a prince with her. Polly said, “Where did you find him and what’s
his name?”
“James Sammy and I met him at a wedding.” Sarah said.
“Oh! how sweet!” Polly said.
“Nice to meet you Polly Polite” the handsome prince said.
“You smell like tuna!’ Polly said.
“Oh.” He said.
“We are here to get married!” Sarah said.
“Wait, I thought we were here to see you rock out. I don’t want to
marry you!” James said, “I want to marry Polly!”
2
Polly married the prince. The rock star rocked out on the stage but
was crying the whole time. She stopped crying for a moment then she cried
into a bucket it had a thousand drips in it and it went all the way up to the
top. She had to tip it out and start all over again. The prince and the
princess lived happily ever after. The rock star spent the rest of her life
crying a million tears into a bucket and starting all over again and again and
again and again and again and again and again and again.

Put the correct number sequence to show the explanation of the water cycle.Paragraph No. The earth has a limited amount of water. We get fresh water through the water cycle. Paragraph No After all these processes, the cycle starts again. Paragraph No. So, over and over again, the water moves from the oceans and the rivers to the clouds. Then it falls into the land as rain and moves back to ocean and rivers.Paragraph No.The water cycle has four parts. The first part is evaporation. Evaporation is when the sun heats up the water from the ocean and rivers and turns into water vapor or steam, this means it changes from liquid into gas. This gas goes into the air.Paragraph No.Then, when so much water has condensed, the clouds become very heavy, and the air cannot hold it anymore, thus precipitation happens. The water falls back to the earth in the form of rain or snow.Paragraph No. The final part of the cycle is collection. Water from precipitation when it ends up on the land, it will either soak into the earth and become part of the ground water that plants and animals use to drink or it may run over the soil and collect in the oceans, rivers and lakes.Paragraph No. The next part of the water cycle is condensation. When water vapor gets cold, it turns into small drops of water. These becomes clouds.​</a>

                            4. Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.

Renewable energy is energy that comes from sources that may naturally be replenished over time.Examples of renewable energy are biomass in general, hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal. Whilethe use of renewable energy is friendlier to the environment, its yield is much less when compared withtraditional sources.2. Everyone should practice CLAYGO or Clean as you go not only in schools but in all places as well. Weshould be responsible for our own waste. If we always rely on somebody else to clean after us, what willhappen if nobody is there to do it anymore? Ensuring the cleanliness of our surroundings should not be theresponsibility of only a few people but of everyone.3. Every morning, George wakes up to the sound of his alarm. It's four o'clock in the morning, He just hadthree hours of sleep coming from a two-hour battle with traffic going home the previous night. Now, hehas to get up again, take a bath, and prepared himself for another two hours of tiresome commute backto work.4. Last week, our class planted some bean seeds in ice-cream cups. We watered the seeds. After that weplaced the cups on the window sill in the sun. About five days later, we observed that some of the seedswere beginning to germinate. A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of theweek, they were about seven centimeters tall.5. Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers, lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into theair. That water vapors form clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on howhigh the clouds is and how cold it is.) As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. Whenthe water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.​</h2><br />

                            6. What is the plot diagram for this story 
Long ago, when the various kinds of animals dwelt together in a kind of community, a dalag (a kind of mud-fish), a dragonfly, a wasp, and a snail agreed to live together in a common house. They furthermore agreed to divide up the different household duties according to their power and skill.
Accordingly, Dalag, since he was the biggest and strongest of all, was made the head of the house. He was also to provide food for his little companions.
Dragon-Fly was made the messenger because he was the swiftest of them all, but was too weak for any other kind of work.
Wasp was made the house-guard because of his poisonous sting. Besides being guard, he was also to keep the house in repair because he could carry bits of earth and other building-materials.
Snail was made the cook because he was too slow for any other duty except tending the house.
Early one day Dalag went out to look for food. He swam slowly here and there among the water-plants when suddenly he saw something moving on the surface of the water.
When he approached nearer, he saw that it was a big frog swimming helplessly among the duck-weeds. “This is a big piece of sweet food for us,” thought Dalag, and without hesitation he seized the frog. When he had assured himself that it could not get away from him, he started to swim home. But, alas! he never reached his companions, for a sharp hook was inside the frog, and poor Dalag was caught fast. He tried hard to free himself, but in vain. Soon a fisherman came and, putting Dalag in his basket, took him home and ate him.
In the meantime, Dalag’s three companions were anxiously waiting for him. When they realized that he was lost, Dragon-Fly was sent out to look for him. Before he went, Dragon-Fly spent a long time arranging his neck-tie. Then he flew away, turning his head in all directions to look for Dalag.
At last he met Bolasi (a kind of fish whose lips always move in and out on the surface of the water), and he became very angry because he thought that Bolasi was laughing at his neck-tie. Dragon-Fly thought that his tie must be too loose, so he tightened it. Still Bolasi laughed every time he saw Dragon-Fly. Dragon-Fly kept drawing his tie tighter and tighter until at last he cut his own head off, and that was the end of him.
Two days had now passed; still Dalag and Dragon-Fly were missing from home. By this time Wasp and Snail were very hungry. But Snail had the advantage over Wasp, for Snail could eat mud to pass away the time, while Wasp could not eat mud but could only draw in his belt a little tighter. At last Wasp could no longer endure his hunger. His abdomen by this time had become very slender, so he flew forth in search of either Dalag or Dragon-Fly. While he was flying about, his hunger oppressed him so much that he tightened his belt again and again until he finally broke in two, and that was the end of Wasp.
Now only Snail was left. He set out from his home and wandered everywhere in search of his three companions, weeping as he went. His food consisted mostly of mud. Whenever he could find a stalk of grass or the stem of a water-plant, Snail would climb up to look around and to see if any of his old friends were in sight.
Even today the snails still weep, and whenever they see a stalk of grass projecting above the surface of the water, they climb up and look around, trying to discover their old friends.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>life circle of dragonfly</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Dragonflies have been around for 300 million years, making them one of the oldest species of insects in the world. Dragonflies have been so successful over the years that the only difference between modern and ancient dragonflies is size. One of the secrets to their success is how they mature. Dragonflies have three stages to their life: egg, nymph and adult. The length of each stage depends on the species of dragonfly. Dragonflies in tropical regions typically spend less time in each stage than dragonflies in temperate regions.</p><br />

Yolanda replied, “Maybe if we kept track of everything we spend,we would have some idea of where our money goes,” “No not that!” Ben exclaimed. “I have a friend who keeps a notebook and lists everything he spends. That would drive me crazy.” “well, we can’t keep going like we have,” responded Yolanda. “ A year ago decided to sort all their check stubs,receipts, and credit card statements to see where their money was going. Last year, they spent over $2,000 in restaurants and cared over $800 in their vacation. I didn’t realize we spent that much on those things” commented Ben. We also had auto maintenance costs of$1,650 and donated $ 1,800 to the homeless shelter and church. Those are things we had to do and wanted to do.” Yolanda replied, “but no that we know how spend our money, what do we do next?” “May we should get a computerized money management program”, Ben suggested Yolanda countered, “Maybe we should just start with spending a few dollars on a notebook and file folders to record and sort our receipts”. QUESTIONS: 1. What would Ben and Yolanda learn by sorting their expenses into various categories? What categories should they use? 2. How can knowing where their money goes help Ben and Yolanda plan their spending? 3. What financial goals might Ben and Yolanda consider to address some of their money management concerns?4.

                            12. Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</h2><br />

                            13. I have been anticipating my senior year since the day I walked into my Kindergarten classroom. I always adored the older kids that only had one year of torture left. However; now that I am a senior, I absolutely cannot wait for the amazing opportunities that will come with this year. As my highschool career comes to an end, I have set some goals to ensure that I will have the best year possible. Although I have moved to a new place, and have been forced to start everything completely over again, I plan to make the most of this year. I want this year to be the best that I have ever had. One of the biggest goals that I have set for my senior year, is to pursue my dream to success. Graduating is a huge part of senior year, and I have been ready to graduate since birth, discover my passions and choose a path to college that will lead me to a successful career that I enjoy.I grew up a lot and matured to a level that allowed me to see my real potentialchanging my past for it is has led me to who I am now. However as I grow and reflect on circumstances that have occurred, I realize that there are instances in which I yearn that I would have done things differently.​</h2><br />

The sand was soft and cool.  We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.  He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!”___________ 2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse.___________ 3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.___________ 4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating.___________ 5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.​</h2><br />

                            17. SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

Condensation - is the changing of water vapor into water droplets forming clouas. Precipitation - is the process of which water droplets fall down to Earth.The sun, being the main source of heat on earth plays the major role inthe water cycle. When the Earth's surface is heated by the sun, evaporationtakes place in the bodies of water and on land.Water particles are also released to the atmosphere from the leaves ofplants through the process of transpiration, Animals and humans give off waterparticies when they perspire during perspiration and during respiration whichevaporato in the atmosphere.When the water vapor in the atmosphere had cooled, condensationprocess will take place. The condensed water vapor in the cloud is transportedand move from one location to another in the atmosphere. When the condensedwater vapor become heavy. it falls back to the Earth in the form of rain, hail,snow, and sleet, this is called precipitationWhen water falls back to the Earth, it ends up on land, it will become partof ground water that animals and humans including plants can use, or it may runover the soil and collect it in the oceans, lakes, rivers where the cycle starts allOver again.The rate of evaporation and condensation is affected by the light and heatof the sun.

We get fresh water through the water cycle Paragraph No After all these processes, the cycle starts again Paragraph No So, over and over again, the water moves from the oceans and the rivers to the clouds. Then it falls into the land as rain and moves back to ocean and rivers Paragraph No. The water cycle has four parts. The first part is evaporation. Evaporation is when the sun heats up the water from the ocean and rivers and turns into water vapor or steam, this means it changes from liquid into gas. This gas goes into the air Paragraph No. Then, when so much water has condensed the clouds become very heavy, and the air cannot hold it anymore, thus precipitation happens. The water fals back to the earth in the form of rain or snow Paragraph No. The final part of the cycle is collection. Water from precipitation when it ends up on the land, it will either soak into the earth and become part of the ground water that plants and animals use to drink or it may run over the soil and collect in the oceans, rivers and lakes.

There are several common reasons why cats won't use kitty doors. First, they may notunderstand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second,many kitty doors are dark, and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they can't be sure of what is on theother side of the door, so they won't take the risk One laat reason cats won't use kitty doors is because somecats don't like the feeling of pushing through the door and having the door drag across their back.

Type your answers in the succeeding box. (20 Points)The City Mouse and the Country MouseOnce a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little Mouse from the city to visit him. When the little City Mouse sat down to dinner he was surprised to find that the Country Mouse had nothing to eat except barley and grain.“Really,” he said, “you do not live well at all; you should see how I live! I have all sorts of fine things to eat every day. You must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city.”The little Country Mouse was glad to do this, and after a while he went to the city to visit his friend.The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived. There, on the lowest shelf, behind some stone jars, stood a big paper bag of brown sugar. The little City Mouse gnawed a hole in the bag and invited his friend to nibble for himself.The two little mice nibbled and nibbled, and the Country Mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life. He was just thinking how lucky the City Mouse was, when suddenly the door opened with a bang, and in came the cook to get some flour.“Run!” whispered the City Mouse. And they ran as fast as they could to the little hole where they had come in. The little Country Mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away, but the little City Mouse said, “That is nothing; she will soon go away and then we can go back.”After the cook had gone away and shut the door they stole softly back, and this time the City Mouse had something new to show: he took the little Country Mouse into a corner on the top shelf, where a big jar of dried prunes stood open. After much tugging and pulling they got a large dried prune out of the jar on to the shelf and began to nibble at it. This was even better than the brown sugar. The little Country Mouse liked the taste so much that he could hardly nibble fast enough. But all at once, in the midst of their eating, there came a scratching at the door and a sharp, loud MIAOUW!“What is that?” said the Country Mouse. The City Mouse just whispered, “Sh!” and ran as fast as he could to the hole.The Country Mouse ran after, you may be sure, as fast as HE could. As soon as they were out of danger the City Mouse said, “That was the old Cat; she is the best mouser in town,–if she once gets you, you are lost.”“This is very terrible,” said the little Country Mouse; “let us not go back to the cupboard again.”“No,” said the City Mouse, “I will take you to the cellar; there is something especial there.”So the City Mouse took his little friend down the cellar stairs and into a big cupboard where there were many shelves. On the shelves were jars of butter, and cheeses in bags and out of bags. Overhead hung bunches of sausages, and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about. It smelled so good that it went to the little Country Mouse’s head. He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here, and a bit of butter there, until he saw an especially rich, very delicious-smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner. He was just on the point of putting his teeth into the cheese when the City Mouse saw him.“Stop! stop!” cried the City Mouse. “That is a trap!”The little Country Mouse stopped and said, “What is a trap?”“That thing is a trap,” said the little City Mouse. “The minute you touch the cheese with your teeth something comes down on your head hard, and you’re dead.”The little Country Mouse looked at the trap, and he looked at the cheese, and he looked at the little City Mouse. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I think I will go home. I’d rather have barley and grain to eat and eat it in peace and comfort, than have brown sugar and dried prunes and cheese,–and be frightened to death all the time!”So the little Country Mouse went back to his home, and there he stayed all the rest of his life.https://bygosh.com/kids-classics/the-city-mouse-and-the-country-mouse/#Break your PLOT of the story into three parts:1.

Princess Polite (Short Story)
by Jasmine Logan, Grade pr, QLD
Once there was a girl called Princess Polite but people in her castle
called her Polly or Polly Polite. One day a super star came to her castle. Polly
said, “Why have you come here? And what is your name?” The super star
said “My name is Sarah Jones. I’m here to rock out on your castle’s stage!”
Polly said, “I don’t have a stage in my castle!”
“Oh dear!” Sarah cried. Polly said, “I will make a grand stage just for
you and I will name it Stage Sarah.” Sarah said.
“You don’t have to call it stage Sarah.” Polly called for the best
builders in the land to come build the stage. The building started. It took
them two years to build it! Polly called Sarah on the phone.
“It’s finished come see!” Polly said.
“Sure, I’ll be there as soon as possible!” Superstar Sarah said. Sarah
brought a prince with her. Polly said, “Where did you find him and what’s
his name?”
“James Sammy and I met him at a wedding.” Sarah said.
“Oh! how sweet!” Polly said.
“Nice to meet you Polly Polite” the handsome prince said.
“You smell like tuna!’ Polly said.
“Oh.” He said.
“We are here to get married!” Sarah said.
“Wait, I thought we were here to see you rock out. I don’t want to
marry you!” James said, “I want to marry Polly!”
2
Polly married the prince. The rock star rocked out on the stage but
was crying the whole time. She stopped crying for a moment then she cried
into a bucket it had a thousand drips in it and it went all the way up to the
top. She had to tip it out and start all over again. The prince and the
princess lived happily ever after. The rock star spent the rest of her life
crying a million tears into a bucket and starting all over again and again and
again and again and again and again and again and again.

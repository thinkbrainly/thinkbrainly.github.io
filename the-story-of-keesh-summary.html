                        The Story of Keesh is about not underestimating the abilities of people.<br /><br />One
 day, Keesh, a teenager, went to the council meeting of his village in 
Klosh-Kwan's igloo. He had spoken to the council to express his thoughts
 on having fair share of meat for everyone. The members of the council 
were surprised for he was only a boy and should not have had 
participated in the council. He opinion was also not heard and the 
members only laughed at him.<br /><br />Because of this embarrassment he 
told the council members that one day they come to him and ask for his 
help. The next day, he went hunting and came back after three days with a
 bear.<br /><br />The council members and other people in the community were
 all shocked that a boy of his age was able to hunt for a bear. He 
continued hunting and never failed to bring a bear.<br /><br />Because the 
people cannot believe how he kills a bear, they accused him of 
witchcraft and without his knowing, the council sent for two men to spy 
on him.<br /><br />They found out that Keesh was not using any kind of 
witchcraft and instead was letting the bear eat a small ball causing the
 bear to be weak and in pain. He then kills the bear with a spear.<br /><br />The
 two men reported this to the council members and when Keesh came home 
they confronted him about his method. He shared that he was using 
whalebone coiled inside a blubber. Once the bear eats the blubber, it 
melts and the whalebone springs inside the bear's stomach causing it 
pain and weakness.

                        <p>Keesh was a thirteen-year-old boy who lived at the North Pole a long time ago. His father died of sruggling with a bear in order to keep the people in the village from starving. After that, Keesh lived alone with his mother. One council Keesh complained about unfair treatment, but other people laughed at him. Therefore, he decided to hunt by himself. Later on, Keesh used his brain to kill many bears and divided them fairly. In the end, Keesh rose to power and became the leader of his people. Keesh is the major character of this story. He appears throughout the story. He is a round character, we can prove that from the beginning of the story and the ending. At the beginning he is a young boy who is innocence, but at the end of the story he becomes a brave man who is respected by the others. He is protagonist character. He has an important role and he is the central figure in the story.</p><p>The Story of Keesh is about a man who "exercised headcraft and not witchcraft, and rose from the meanest IGLOO to be head man of his village." London's story was published in 1907.</p><p>An illustration for the story The Story of Keesh by the author Jack London</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>KEESH lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his village through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the old men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their children's children down to the end of time. And the winter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the ice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may venture forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the poorest IGLOO in the village, rose to power and place over them all.</p><p></p><p>He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had seen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one another's faces. The father of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a time of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and after that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone to forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a boy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the IGLOOS.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SHEP O'NEAL: Keesh lived at the edge of the polar sea. He had seen thirteen suns in the Eskimo way of keeping time. Among the Eskimos, the sun each winter leaves the land in darkness. And the next year, a new sun returns, so it might be warm again.</p><p>The father of Keesh had been a brave man. But he had died hunting for food. Keesh was his only son. Keesh lived along with his mother, Ikeega.</p><p>One night, the village council met in the big igloo of Klosh-kwan, the chief. Keesh was there with the others. He listened, then waited for silence.</p><p>He said, “It is true that you give us some meat. But it is often old and tough meat, and has many bones.”</p><p>The hunters were surprised. This was a child speaking against them. A child talking like a grown man!</p><p>Keesh said, “My father, Bok, was a great hunter. It is said that Bok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters. And that he divided the meat so that all got an equal share.”</p><p>“Naah! Naah!” the hunters cried. “Put the child out! Send him to bed. He should not talk to gray-beards this way!”</p><p>Keesh waited until the noise stopped. “You have a wife, Ugh-gluk,” he said. “And you speak for her. My mother has no one but me. So I speak. As I say, Bok hunted greatly, but is now dead. It is only fair then that my mother, who was his wife, and I, his son, should have meat when the tribe has meat. I, Keesh, son of Bok, have spoken.”</p><p>Again, there was a great noise in the igloo. The council ordered Keesh to bed. It even talked of giving him no food.</p><p>Keesh jumped to his feet. “Hear me!” he cried. “Never shall I speak in the council igloo again. I shall go hunt meat like my father, Bok.”</p><p>There was much laughter when Keesh spoke of hunting. The laughter followed Keesh as he left the council meeting.</p><p>The next day, Keesh started out for the shore, where the land meets the ice. Those who watched saw that he carried his bow and many arrows. Across his shoulder was his father’s big hunting spear. Again there was laughter.</p><p>One day passed, then a second. On the third day, a great wind blew. There was no sign of Keesh. His mother, Ikeega, put burned seal oil on her face to show her sorrow. </p><br />

                        I think his motivation in the story was to prove his capabilities that he can hunt the ravish polar bears in their village and prove that despite being young , he has the strength to fight in par with the adults and elder hunters . He simply wants to follow the footsteps of his father which was long forgotten by the villagers . He wants to prove his worth as a hunter to the adults and elders who tried to ridicule him for having such a big goal for a young boy .<br />

He returned in town after 3 days with a bear. He continued hunting bears and the townspeople could not believe it. They accused him of witchcraft so the council members sent a spy to see how he does it.<br /><br />They found that Keesh was luring the bear into eating a small ball that causes extreme pain and weakness to the bear.

to feed his fellow villagers.  Being inspired to his father's notable 
deed, he emboldened himself and proved that he can do great as his 
father. Even if he was ridiculed,scorned, and doubted, Keesh was 
encouraged to hunt alone. His courage and will to continue his father's 
deeds made him more determined to be successful in hunting.<br />He 
returned to his village with a freshly-killed bear on his shoulders. His
 feat swept away his mother's sadness.  For so many times,he always 
return home with freshly-hunted ice-bears.<br />We can say that Keesh was 
truly a dignified and a great huntsman because, despite of being accused
 with all sorts, he never backed down.  <br /><br />

                            28. the story of keesh summary </h2><br />
                        Keesh was a son of a great huntsman and a well respected member in their tribe. Unfortunately, Keesh's father died when he was very young. After some time, his father's contribution to the tribe was forgotten. As he got older, Keesh addressing the council that he would be a great hunter like his past father was seen as precocious. He declared that he would honor his father's memory and become a great hunter and bring the wealthiest meat for the people of the tribe. They let him go on his own in the forest. It took him four days til he returned with an enormous burden of meat. The villagers were stunned by the success of his quest, which grew suspicion. The council sent two men to scout on Keesh as he went to his exhibition. They returned several days later, having been successful in trailing Keesh to his kill, an enormous (and dangerous) polar bear. They told a tale that the tribal council simply couldn’t believe. Upon his return, the tribe gathered in Keesh’s igloo to accuse him of witchcraft. He answered their charges well. Keesh explained the source of his hunting success. He explained why the two scouts sent to follow him observed him striding up to the bear, enraging it, and convincing it to follow him. He explained why the scouts witnessed his leaving small round balls of food on the ice for the bear, and why the bear soon became ill, and deranged. He explained how he was then able to spear the bear without endangering himself.<br />

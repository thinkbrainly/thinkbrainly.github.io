A Woodcutter was hard at work beside a river. He chopped down a tree and chopped off the branches, one by one. He stacked the small branches in one pile and the large branches in another pile. It was hard work, and he grew tired. By accident, he dropped his axe into the deep river. He sat down on the river bank, and put his his head in his hands. The Woodcutter heard a sound in the nearby bushes. He lifted his head and was amazed to see a strange little man dressed all in green. He thought perhaps it was one of the Wood Gnomes of the fairy tales, and he was quite correct. "Why are you so upset?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter explained what had happened, and the Wood Gnome walked closer to the bank of the deep river and dived right in headfirst. In moments he climbed out, carrying a golden axe. "Is this your axe, sir?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter shook his head with sorrow. The Wood Gnome dived back into the river, and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" he asked. Again, the woodcutter shook his head, and again the Wood Gnome dived into the river. This time, the Wood Gnome came out of the river with the Woodcutter's own axe, and the Woodcutter shouted out with joy. The Wood Gnome told the Woodcutter that he must keep the gold and silver axes as well as his own, as a reward for his honesty. The Woodcutter went home and told all of his friends what had happened, and showed them the gold and silver axes. The next day, one of those friends went to the place by the river that the Woodcutter had described. He threw his axe into the river, and sat down on the riverbank and cried. The Wood Gnome appeared, and asked the man why he was crying. The man said that he had dropped his axe into the river by mistake, and the Wood Gnome quickly dived into the river, and came up with a golden axe. "Is this your axe?" the Wood Gnome asked, and the man reached for it greedily, saying that it was the very axe he had lost. The Wood Gnome kept the golden axe, and left without going back into the river for the axe that the dishonest man had thrown there on purpose.

                                            explanation or factual text typeSummary: When it rains in highlands, water that flows downhill gets drained into the space created by the root system of plants. Due to this chance of flooding is greatly reduced. If there are more trees in an area that is prone to water runoffs, the root system of trees can create space between these rocks and hence reduce the amount of water being dumped into lakes and rivers.​</a>

                                            The Abulaw Dam brought the Agno River under control. Because the dam created a reservolr of water, the water was used to irrigate dry farmland. It was also used as a water supply by nearby cities and towns. But the biggest benefit of Abulaw Dam is its hydroelectric power. The dam produces a huge amount of electricity. However, this huge dam has had bad effects on the environment. The river can no longer carry rich soll to the lands its flooded. Fish and other wildlife have lost their homes. For this reason, the landscape of the area will never be the same.what is a problem?what is a solution?what is a summary?​</a>

                                            The Abulaw Dam brought the Agno River under control. Because the dam created a reservoir of water, the water was used to irrigate dry farmland. It was also used as a water supply by nearby cities and towns. But the biggest benefit of Abulaw Dam is its hydroelectric power. The dam produces a huge amount of electricity. However, this huge dam has had bad effects on the environment. The river can no longer carry rich soil to the lands its flooded. Fish and other wildlife have lost their homes. For this reason, the landscape of the area will never be the same.

                                            The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines?

Trees give us food, clothing and shelter. Medicine also comes from some trees and plants. Trees absorb water through its roots and send out water vapour through its leaves, thus making the air around us much cooler. Forest trees regulate the flow of water and keep our rivers and streams supplied with ground water all year round. They also prevent excess water from flowing and flooding low-lying areas which destroy homes and forms.​</a>

These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense.

                            3. As you read this story, look for the main idea of each paragraph. These can be put together to make a summary of the whole story. A Woodcutter was hard at work beside a river. He chopped down a tree and chopped off the branches, one by one. He stacked the small branches in one pile and the large branches in another pile. It was hard work, and he grew tired. By accident, he dropped his axe into the deep river. He sat down on the river bank, and put his his head in his hands. The Woodcutter heard a sound in the nearby bushes. He lifted his head and was amazed to see a strange little man dressed all in green. He thought perhaps it was one of the Wood Gnomes of the fairy tales, and he was quite correct. "Why are you so upset?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter explained what had happened, and the Wood Gnome walked closer to the bank of the deep river and dived right in headfirst. In moments he climbed out, carrying a golden axe. "Is this your axe, sir?" asked the Wood Gnome. The Woodcutter shook his head with sorrow. The Wood Gnome dived back into the river, and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" he asked. Again, the woodcutter shook his head, and again the Wood Gnome dived into the river. This time, the Wood Gnome came out of the river with the Woodcutter's own axe, and the Woodcutter shouted out with joy. The Wood Gnome told the Woodcutter that he must keep the gold and silver axes as well as his own, as a reward for his honesty. The Woodcutter went home and told all of his friends what had happened, and showed them the gold and silver axes. The next day, one of those friends went to the place by the river that the Woodcutter had described. He threw his axe into the river, and sat down on the riverbank and cried. The Wood Gnome appeared, and asked the man why he was crying. The man said that he had dropped his axe into the river by mistake, and the Wood Gnome quickly dived into the river, and came up with a golden axe. "Is this your axe?" the Wood Gnome asked, and the man reached for it greedily, saying that it was the very axe he had lost. The Wood Gnome kept the golden axe, and left without going back into the river for the axe that the dishonest man had thrown there on purpose. TITLE OF THE STORY: MAIN IDEA SUPPORTING DETAILS SUMMARY 1. 2. 3.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The title of the story is "The Woodcutter and the Wood Gnome." The main idea of the story is that honesty is always rewarded. The woodcutter is rewarded with two golden axes for being honest about losing his axe in the river. The dishonest man is not rewarded and is left without his axe. The story also teaches that it is better to be honest and have nothing than to be dishonest and have something. </p><p></p><p>The story begins with a woodcutter chopping down a tree and stacking the branches in two piles. He accidentally drops his axe into the river and sits down on the bank, feeling upset. Suddenly, a strange little man dressed all in green appears and asks the woodcutter why he is upset. The woodcutter explains that he lost his axe in the river. The little man, who is actually a wood gnome, dives into the river and comes up with a golden axe. He asks the woodcutter if it is his axe, but the woodcutter says no. The wood gnome dives back into the river and comes up with a silver axe. Again, he asks the woodcutter if it is his axe, but the woodcutter says no. The wood gnome dives into the river a third time and comes up with the woodcutter's own axe. The woodcutter is overjoyed and thanks the wood gnome. The wood gnome tells the woodcutter that he must keep the two golden axes as a reward for his honesty. </p><p></p><p>The woodcutter goes home and tells his friends what happened. The next day, one of his friends goes to the river and pretends to accidentally drop his axe into the river. He sits down on the bank and cries, and the wood gnome appears. The man says that he lost his axe in the river and the wood gnome dives in and comes up with a golden axe. The man grabs the axe and runs away, without even thanking the wood gnome. The wood gnome does not give chase and simply lets the man keep the golden axe.</p><p></p><p>The moral of the story is that honesty is always rewarded. The woodcutter is an honest man and is rewarded with two golden axes. The dishonest man is not rewarded and is left without his axe.</p><p></p><p>This story also teaches that it is better to be honest and have nothing than to be dishonest and have something. The woodcutter is honest and loses his axe, but he is still better off than the dishonest man who pretends to lose his axe. The dishonest man gets a golden axe, but he is left without his original axe and he does not have the respect of the wood gnome.</p><p></p><p>The story ends with the woodcutter being rewarded for his honesty and the dishonest man being punished for his dishonesty.</p><br />

                            4. explanation or factual text typeSummary: When it rains in highlands, water that flows downhill gets drained into the space created by the root system of plants. Due to this chance of flooding is greatly reduced. If there are more trees in an area that is prone to water runoffs, the root system of trees can create space between these rocks and hence reduce the amount of water being dumped into lakes and rivers.​</h2><br />

It was also used as a water supply by nearby cities and towns. But the biggest benefit of Abulaw Dam is its hydroelectric power. The dam produces a huge amount of electricity. However, this huge dam has had bad effects on the environment. The river can no longer carry rich soll to the lands its flooded. Fish and other wildlife have lost their homes.

It was also used as a water supply by nearby cities and towns. But the biggest benefit of Abulaw Dam is its hydroelectric power. The dam produces a huge amount of electricity. However, this huge dam has had bad effects on the environment. The river can no longer carry rich soil to the lands its flooded. Fish and other wildlife have lost their homes.

The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian. All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense. 1. How many islands are found in the Philippines?

                            18. 1. Make a 4 sentence summary of this paragraph TREES" (10 pts) TREES Trees are one of the most important things on Earth. Trees give us food, clothing and shelter. Medicine also comes from some trees and plants. Trees absorb water through its roots and send out water vapour through its leaves, thus making the air around us much cooler. Forest trees regulate the flow of water and keep our rivers and streams supplied with ground water all year round. They also prevent excess water from flowing and flooding low-lying areas which destroy homes and forms.​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. Trees improve air quality.</p><p>Trees are sometimes called the lungs of the Earth because they absorb pollutants through their leaves, trapping (or “sequestering”), and filtering contaminants in the air. Like all green plants, trees also produce oxygen through photosynthesis.</p><p></p><p>2. Trees improve water quality, and reduce flooding and erosion.</p><p>A tree’s leafy canopy catches precipitation before it reaches the ground, allowing some of it to gently drip and the rest to evaporate. Tree roots hold soil in place, reducing erosion. In these ways, trees lessen the force of storms and reduce the amount of runoff into sewers, streams, and rivers, improving water quality. One hundred mature trees can intercept about 100,000 gallons of rainfall per year.</p><p></p><p>3. Trees temper climate.</p><p>Trees lower air temperatures and humidity; they can also influence wind speed. Evaporation of water from trees, or transpiration, has a cooling effect. Cities develop “heat islands” because dark roofs and pavement absorb solar energy and radiate it back. Trees in parking lots have been shown to reduce asphalt temperatures by 36 degrees Fahrenheit and car interiors by up to 47 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p></p><p>4. Trees conserve energy.</p><p>Three or more large trees strategically placed on sunny sides of a house shade it from the hot summer sun, reducing air-conditioning costs by as much as 30 percent. Deciduous trees are best for this use because they lose their leaves in winter, exposing the house to the warming winter sun, which lowers the energy needed to heat the house. Coniferous trees, because they retain their needles year-round, serve to reduce wind when placed on the north and northwest sides of a building, resulting in significantly lower winter heating costs.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The paragraph itself says it, that trees are important, it helps us on our daily living. Without trees our living is disaster. The trees are giving us a better life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Trees improve water quality, and reduce flooding and erosion. A tree's leafy canopy catches precipitation before it reaches the ground, allowing some of it to gently drip and the rest to evaporate. Tree roots hold soil in place, reducing erosion. In these ways, trees lessen the force of storms and reduce the amount of runoff into sewers, streams, and rivers, improving water quality. One hundred mature trees can intercept about 100,000 gallons of rainfall per year.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:D</p><br />

services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known
as Consumer Act of the Philippines is a law that
protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act
(Banzon, et al. 2005).

Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccinesThe Philippine government starts giving the first shots of a Corona Virus vaccine on Monday, March 1, Nurse Chareluck Santos legally administers the first Covid-19 vaccine in the country to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines- Philippine General Hospital.Food and Drug Administration Director, General Eric Domingo, Government Medical Adviser Dr. Edsel Salvaña and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. were also vaccinated, Monday. Vaccinations also takes place among health workers at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.The vaccinations are part of the first batch of vaccines to arrive from China, Sunday. The 600, 000 doses of Sinovac's Corona vaccine are donated from the Chinese government. The Sinovac vaccine had an efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil involving health workers. But phase 3 trials showed an efficacy rate of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years sold. The World Helath Organization (WHO) early said a 50% efficacy rating is acceptable for vaccines. Though the Duterte government targeted to start distributing vaccines by February, The Philippines is now the last country in Southeast Asia to start vaccinating its residents.Meantime, Preside Duterte says he will go to China to personally thank Chines ident Jinping for their vaccine donation when the pandemic settles down. "I want to do it personally because China has been good and the way that they are helping us right now- I suppose the debt of gratitude should be paid by a personal visit." In, related news, the arrival of over half a million vaccine doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the global COVAX facility on Monday is postponed. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III says this is because of a global supplyproblem. WHO said they encountered problems with supply, so it will be delayed for about a week.QUESTIONS:1.

 In the Visayas, Lapu-Lapu, the brave hero of Mactan, Cebu, is known to all as the first Filipino who fought the Spaniards led by Ferdinand Magellan. His golden statue stands proud and erect in the heart of the city to remind the people of his bravery. Cebu also has the Sto. Nino Shrine, which is frequented by devotees.

One gets to see not only modern hotels, big buildings, and shopping malls but also vast plantation of pineapples, bananas, cacao, and many other. Davao City is a big city that offers fun and adventure. It is regarded as the commercial and economic center of Mindanao.

role in consumer protection. A consumer has rights
mandated by law. These are privileges that an
individual is guaranteed of health products and
services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known
as Consumer Act of the Philippines is a law that
protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act

The 600, 000 doses of Sinovac's Corona vaccine are donated from the Chinese government. The Sinovac vaccine had an efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil involving health workers.

                                            Directions: Read the excerpt below from Mandela's speech, "The Rainbow Nation" and underline the five (5) emphasis markers used. yu gat igir ku! m ga a Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</a>

This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time democracy also requires that the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded. The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. The cornerstone of building a better life of opportunity, freedom and prosperity is the Reconstruction and Development Programme. This needs unity of purpose. It needs in action. It requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. They want changel And change is what they will get. Our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. The government will devise policies that encourage and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - African, Coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroads into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.  ​</h2><br />

                            23. democracy is based on the majoruty principle. this is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rigths. at the same time, democracy also requires that the rigth of political and other minorities be safeguarded. the task at hand on will not be easy. but you have mandated us to change south africa from a country in which the majority lived witg little hope, to one in whicg they can live and work with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the future. the cornerstone of building a better life of opportunitt, freedon and prosperity is the reconstruction and development programme. this needs unity of pupose. it needs in action. it requires us all to work together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and build a nation united in our diversity. the people of south africa have spoken in these elections. they want change! and change is what they will get. our plan is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to guarantee freedom for all south africans. we will tackle the widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our people. by encoyraging investors and the demicratic state to support job creating projects in which manufacturinf will play a central role we will try to change our country from a net exporter of raw material to one that exports finished products through beneficiation. the goverment will devise policies that encourage and reward productive and reward productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - african, coloured and indian. by easing credit conditions we can assist them to make inroeds into the productive and manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale distribution to which they are presently confined. while we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit of a goverment of national unity, we are determined to initiate and bring about the change that our mandate from the people demands. we place our vision of a new constitutional order for south africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the conqyered. we speak as fellow citizens to heak the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order based on justice for all. this is the challenge that faces all south africans today, and it is one to which i am certain we will all rise. read another excerpt from mandela's speech, “the rainbow nation” and underline the emphasis markers used. an example is provided for you!Plssssss paki sagot po ng maayosunderline the emphasis markers used​</h2><br />
